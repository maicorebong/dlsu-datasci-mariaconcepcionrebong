I thought the Overtime changes put in recently were gonna be great and a better, fairer reflection of the performance in the game. However, playing a game recently it went overtime and it was a slog with both teams doing well. We got to 15-15 and the game immediately ended as each time both teams win a round in an overtime bracket it goes to a vote to draw and the more overtime rounds played the fewer and fewer votes are needed to end the match in a draw. So ultimately at 15-15 it needs one person to press draw to end the game. The entire lobby (apart from one guy apparently) were on board that we had got this far, it was a tense encounter with my team communication and teamwork (not premade) being really solid and on point. The way the game ended like that with no reward to either side felt awful and unenjoyable.

Contrary to many opinions, I can roughly understand why gun skins are priced how they are. However, what I find difficult in this situation is the pressure placed on the buyer to get a bundle over an individual gun skin. Sure, bundles should always provide perks to incentivize their purchase, but in Valorant bundles, the price difference is so extreme so as to make me feel bad if I don't get the bundle.

 In the case of elderflame, it is shown in the shop as being around $61 cheaper than purchasing the skins individually, thus, if only getting one or two items, there's a sense that you 'might as well' get the bundle. At smaller price points, this is no biggie, but at these higher price tiers this means individuals may be pressured to spend $10, $20, $40 more than they're comfortable with if they like these skins.

 If the difference between individual and bundle pricing were less severe, this wouldn't be as much of an issue",VALORANT,The biggest issue with skin prices is the difference between individual and bundle pricing

Need help from veterans about DPI, sens, wrist and arm player.

So i have never playing games like Valorant at all, never touched csgo. Used to play overwatch but Junkrat and reaper main.

The thing is since i started playing games i only used my wrist for mouse movement and its kinda being hard for me in Valorant.  
When i use my wrist i use 1600 dpi and 0.34 sens, i get average kills and i play comfortably but i miss the easiest shots sometimes since my sens is high.

I decided to use my arm now and using 800 DPI with 0.48 sens. My aim is consistent but i don't get many kills and on top of that i feel awkward/uncomfortable using my arm that much.

/ on your hud it should show which kind of skins of the gun you have instead of just saying vandal even though you own a skin ([https://imgur.com/NdmdmQC](https://imgur.com/NdmdmQC))

/ on by menu it should display your skin that you own instead of default one ([https://imgur.com/yflxVVS](https://imgur.com/yflxVVS))

/ display skin tiers on collection cause basically once you buy skins on the store it has no meaning and you have no idea what kind of tier they belong to and it basically makes no sense even to have those tiers if once you buy them it doesn't show up anymore ([https://imgur.com/DnnebCs](https://imgur.com/DnnebCs))

/ make skin collections per agents happen and let people modify their loadouts per different agent (for example you have five vandal skins and you wan't to have them all in game so you have one for Viper, one for Reyna and etc)

/ it's kinda unfair that after every game you get experience only for playing rounds and winning them so basically if you are winning hard you kinda should lose some rounds in order to get more experience points for battlepass this shouldn't be a thing or there should be one more criteria like performance (for example if you are match or team mvp you would get some sort of experience boost like maximum up to 1000) and other players would get experience not for KDA and etc because it would be unfair support player wise but for their role on the team (for example sage would get experience points for healing, ultimate, slows and so on) duelists would get their experience boosts from first bloods, kills, clutches and etc. this would kinda solve the battlepass grind problem and you would be more focused on your role in order to get the additional experience points.

/ i have an additional idea for battlepass. as we all know grinding battlepass is kinda annoying and has a very dry feel but maybe new feature like as you buy the battlepass on every act it would say get kills with weapon let's say on the act II it would say: get kills with ghost (0 / 1000) (the amount can change with gun usage and etc for example bucky or odin would have much less kills needed to reach the goal than vandal or phantom) when you reach the goal you would gain additional skin for the task that you completed. in my opinion this would push people to play this game even more and they would be awarded for playing the game and paying money for battlepass.

thanks for the long read and i would love to hear people opinions about the things that i just wrote out!",VALORANT,new features for valorant

90,Futureshot2,1594355379,hoihep,12,1,"A small rant about things I don’t agree with/should be in the game.

First of all, moving accuracy is ridiculous.  You shouldn’t be able to swing around a corner at full speed and be able to headshot someone over 15 feet/4.6 meters away from you.  The amount of times I have killed or been killed by somebody running is ridiculous.  It feels like I am playing Overwatch, especially in unrated.

Second, Split and ascent feel way too defender sided.  Having two chokepoints to get onto site, or having to push a basic no man’s land(mid), which defenders can stop by utility dumping on areas the attackers need to push to be able to get to a point where they can take site.  If the attackers use their own utility it ends up leaving the attackers with little utility left to actually take site, or little to actually defend site with.

Third, the competitive algorithm seems to benefit duelists more than support agents, which in turn causes less people to play them and more people to play duelists.  The algorithm could count enemies blocked by smoke as ‘points’, enemies tagged/revealed as ‘points’, or enemies slowed as ‘points’ to help a player’s score in the match go up and help increase their rank. 

Fourth, it would be great to be able to unselect an agent.  Sometimes confusion in the agent selection screen cause there to be no sage, too many duelists, or no smoke agents.

Fifth, viper and breach are hilariously underpowered with pick rates insanely low.  Something simple as viper being able to pick up her wall or breach having an extra flash could boost viability and pick rates for those agents.

Sixth, and honestly the least, the battle pass has turned into a chore.  Daily missions do not give you enough bonus xp so it feels like you have to play a ton of matches to level up in the pass.  Sometimes it just isn’t enjoyable to grind some of the weekly missions either.  Stuff like ult 50 times is so redundant and requires too many matches.

I am Gold 2 currently and these seem to be some problems plaguing gameplay.  I do not have a real main as I play anyone, but Jett is the most enjoyable for me.  I would love to hear y’alls opinions but am posting this before bed so I will get to you in the mornings.",VALORANT,A valoRANT

I had to clutch multiple rounds with aces and quadra kills, I was having an insane game, my aim was on point (it’s usually terribly average) and my plays were going great. But at the end of the game, after all that hard work I only gain ONE green arrow up...so I just don’t get how the mmr gain works in this game.

117,R3znatrth0mps0n,1594494601,hpfpyb,2,1,"I am genuinely lost in how rating is scored in Valorant. There is an abundance of information that to help you determine where you land. (MVP titles, Overall KDA, Econ, over score rating and W/L variance (close or not close games), that little arrow system that doesn't seem to account for shit) Reading the patch notes gave information on how its supposed to work, but just seems either very one side or extremely diverse in a way where the information you get post games means jack shit.

I have had two experiences where my overall score average would be higher across a set of 5 ranked games (same amount that determines your placement rank). On both occasions he average 3 wins I had would be 13-9 or 13-10 and my two loses would be 13-7.13-9. Both times id get 3 up arrows and one 2 arros. the loses are one arrow down and derank. Ill even get team MVP during a loss. If i calculate my score rating between 5 games to find my average, it doesn't seem to reflect when i get ranked or even deranked. I have literally ranked up after getting stomped in a game where I got carried and went from gold 1 to gold 2. 

Outside of just getting good and shooting people in the face, can anyone shine some light on how the fuck riot decides where you belong in its comp system? 

I don't care where I place, I just really enjoy playing the game. I could be silver for all I care. I just want to know how to interpret the information I am given because its not clear at all on how it effects you",VALORANT,Can anyone shed light on how the criteria is for ranking and deranking works?

Two being the worst, my game mid ranked match round dropped to 3 fps....For no reason, nothing I could see. It only fixed itself and jumped back to 150fps after I died and the round was over. I don't think its my computer, so I would chalk it up to some background optimization issues with the patch/graphics in game. Or that vgc is acting up/consuming too many resources. I have caught it before at the main menu at 20% cpu usage. Anyone else experiencing this? I have seen some fps issue posts but not any with the drop like I experienced.

One of the solvable issues currently is that a lack of utility leads to OPs being able to hold strong, aggressive angles with little counter play (depending on the agent you play). 


So, the solution is to provide a bit more utility to players without being overbearing. I suggest players before the game be able to choose a smoke or a flash. Brimstone would likely want a flash to augment his smoke-heavy playstyle, for instance. 

This means that utility can be somewhat constant across games - leading to more consistency in denying OP positions while also providing players meaningful choices that can add to the skill ceiling of the game.",VALORANT,Suggestion to solve OP problem: 1 Free Flash or Smoke

The slow pace of the game plus attacking side can feel downright stifling at times 

Not to mention the OP meta needs to be reworked somehow. In CSGO a team wouldn’t dare run more than 2 AWPs at once, but in Valorant a defensive team with 3-4 OPs means they are in a great position. 

In CSGO de_train is the most CT sided map and an AWPer’s paradise because of the long distances and narrow lanes. De_train is also the most disliked map amongst puggers because of the synergy that’s needed for T side. Every map in Valorant basically feels like de_train, especially Ascent. 

I think I need a break from this game until the meta changes. Having 3+ OPs on defense should be risky and not a strong setup. However, the slow pace of the game and the sight lines makes OPs very strong.

To compensate, I think the OP needs a much longer delay to shoot between each shot. As of now you can’t trade kill an OPer. Players move too slowly to close the distance. There needs to be time for an attacking team to trade the OPer and increasing the time between shots will help.",VALORANT,This game is exhausting to play.
203,Harblair,1594564217,hpv9l2,5,2,"INTRO:

RIOT, it’s no secret that the community is upset with how RP works currently.  It feels unfair.  You can’t advertise a $100 bundle as these animated insanely cool dragons for people to find out they have to pay more money in some way to unlock those styles.  Someone already calculated that it would be $250+ to unlock the dragon bundle completely without the battle pass of course.

Solution 1:  

Make skins more valuable by including all tiers/cosmetic variations in the current price.  This will justify the price for a lot of players including myself.

Solution 2:  

Have a system that rewards RP for every win/loss.  2 RP per win and 1 RP per loss.  Spike rush obviously not included.  This means that someone would have to win 5 games to unlock 1 basic tier (roughly 3 hours of gameplay).

Conclusion:

I feel as if the community would agree that Solution 2 is best for both parties.  Players can either choose to grind roughly 25 hours in straight wins to upgrade one of their Elderflame skins all the way or they can choose to purchase RP in the store.  I’m curious, let me know what you think about the current RP system.",VALORANT,How RIOT can correct the RP situation

Hi!

A few days ago i posted that i got the error code 0 and couldnt play

Well i looked over what riot had told me to do with my computer to fix a thing.

I noticed one and thought imma redo this but undo all the stuff they told me to do.

Anyways

Riot told me the following :

If you would like, you can also follow the instructions given into this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX4scKXpGGI).

1. Also please do ensure that you do not have any unwanted programs running, follow these steps on this guide to perform a clean boot:

[https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#clean-boot-guide-0-9](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#clean-boot-guide-0-9)

It's important that you have the latest [**WINDOWS UPDATES**](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq). VALORANT is optimized tao work best when on the latest version of Windows and updating can resolve a number of issues.

Along with that, you should also try temporarily disabling any antivirus program you might have.

So i did the opposite than what they told me to do and now i can enter again.

I know I'm not owed a reason but one would be better to understand why they are so high. If the money was going to price pools for tournaments or something.

As of right now, I've wanted to buy every bundle but I can't justify spending 75 to 100 plus dollars and then having to spend more to upgrade them. How is that right? You buy a 100$ worth of and you don't even get the full product? Most of it is behind a paywall? If this was EA we would all have our pitchforks out.

They have said that they put stuff in the game knowing it's broken and seeing how the community reacts. How do we know there are not doing the same thing with these bundles? If we boycott the game maybe we can bring the prices down?

I just don't see how anyone can justify it. I don't believe because it's a free game and it's cosmetics justify this kind of pricing. I would prefer paying full price if I got the skins for free and then you only had to pay for the radiant and be able to unlock it by grinding the game.

Hi guys,

I've run into a weird issue playing Valorant. I recently switched to a new headset (Old: Sennheiser Game One - New: Corsair Virtuoso SE). I have no issues with it except in Valorant. In Valorant, on wired mode on the headset, my sound is loud per usual, like my old headset. However, on wireless mode with the new headset, the sound is lower. I ran a decibel meter while playing to test and it was true; Valorant volume was lower on wireless mode. I thought it was a headset issue, but I tested in Discord, Spotify, and even CSGO and Valorant was the only app which lowered the sound on wireless mode.

I checked the Windows 10 volume mixer and Valorant was always at 100%.

I was thinking that perhaps something in Valorant could be interfering with something, perhaps iCUE or the USB dongle I am using for the headset on wireless mode. 

If you have any suggestions or a fix, please let me know!",VALORANT,PLEASE HELP! Low sound only on Wireless Headset

I have seen videos of what to do to improve. I have been trying to use the practice range before I go play norms. To practice my aim and reflexes.

But that rarely happens, because people learn very quickly that holding an angle and having good positioning gets them far more kills than mechanical aim. Frankly speaking, most things that benefit a player's individual performance also benefits the team.

Yes, I know that valorant already has individual performance ""accounted for"" in ranks below immortal, but the weightage is simply not enough. If you are match mvp with 32:17 kd and lose the match 10:13, there is no way that you should be able to drop rank.

The only consequence of this unfair system is frustrating solo queue, which I suppose has its roots in league.

Basically, brax was spamming through a smoke and got killed by someone flanking. Then, jason who was already dead and spectating, asked him why didn't he shoot the guy behind the smoke. I thought that was interesting, because I belive a big reason of why the smokes are the way they are on Valorant is to avoid issues like this, so I went ahead to jason's stream to clip it and compare.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/wqhEmYu) you can see a frame to frame comparison (or as close as I could get) of both POV's. Notice how jason can clearly see Sage on the edge of the smoke while brax has no clue. If you look at the clips, brax did see Sage on the edge of the smoke at some point, but never as clear and as much as jason did.

I personally always play with everything set to the low. But if you don't, just dropping the detail quality to low will remove the 'glow' effect of the smoke.

402,gabrielC55,1594758543,hr9ah2,284,259,"Viper, as a controller, should be seen as an alternative to Brimstone or Omen, and she actually has all the tools she needs to fill the role. She has two decent mollies, the biggest smoke in the game, and her wall, which in my opinion, is the best LoS-blocking ability in the entire game. So why isn't she as popular as the other controllers? 

# 1. Ease of Use

This is hands down her biggest problem. As mentioned before, Viper has all the utility she needs to execute, and also defend a site. The issue is that she can't do it properly. Viper has to equip her smoke, throw it, wait for it to land, and finally activate it. Meanwhile, Brimstone and Omen can both pinpoint exactly where they want their smokes to go, and can do so without exposing themselves or using complicated lineups. This alone already makes Viper a far less attractive option. To make things even worse, she has to be within cuddling distance of her smoke to pick it up, and as a result, she is forced to commit to smoking a single location, and requires a long time to prepare her smoke to use it on another location. This is, once again, a problem other controllers simply don't have to deal with.

Her wall also had this problem, but after the buffs it is now very easy to use effectively and no longer requires lineups. There is little reason to not buff her poison orb in a similar way.

# 2. Presence

Cypher's Cyber Cages make noise if the enemy pushes through them. That means it's suicide to walk into it instead of waiting it out, since it is very easy for Cypher to shoot through his smokes to punish anyone trying to walk into site. 

Brimstone and Omen can smoke a single location multiple times, forcing the enemy to push through them if they want to take control of a choke point. If this is not necessary, they can use their smokes in different locations.

And guess what, Viper has none of those benefits. If she uses *all* her fuel, the poison orb lasts 15s (same time of Brim and Omen smokes), and so does the wall. If both are activated at the same time, her fuel barely lasts 10s. Which just isn't worth it. After her fuel is fully depleted, she has to wait 20 whole seconds for it to fully recharge. Therefore, she has to wait 20s to use use ONE of her abilities for another 15s.

As a result, it's simply impossible for Viper's utility to be as present as the other controllers' utility. She can only smoke one spot at a time, and it isn't any harder to push through her smoke wheh compared to Brim or Omen smokes since the Decay debuff does nothing. 

# 3. Possible Solutions

I believe Viper doesn't need more raw map control power, since she already has plenty. What she needs is more ways to use her utility effectively. Her entire kit is strong, but she needs to have an easier time taking advantage of it. So how should she be changed? Here are some suggestions:

* Remove the faster depletion of her fuel if both of her abilities are active (or even better, make her fuel recharge faster)
* Allow Viper to pick up her smoke from a distance, just like Cypher can pick up his camera and traps
* Change the Fragile debuff so it lasts 2-4 seconds after leaving the AoE (So Viper has a better opportunity to punish anyone pushing through it)

These are relatively small changes that, when combined, are pretty substantial. If they STILL aren't enough, here are some crazier, maybe unbalanced ones:

* Let Viper re-use her wall after 35s (just like any other signature ability). If she deploys a new wall, the previous one just disappears.
* Make the Decay debuff much more aggressive, dealing damage slightly faster, but more importantly, making it so it takes a very long time to fully recover from the debuff. The main focus of this is to make her ult actually scary to walk inside of.

If you're still here, thanks for reading! If you're wondering why i didn't talk about her ult as much, it's because i honestly don't know how to buff it without making it extremely overpowered. It surely is in an awkward spot right now, but i don't think it's as bad as people say it is.",VALORANT,"It's been 3 weeks since the Viper buffs, here's why they weren't enough."

If you test this theory and aim DEAD CENTER of the target bullseye in practice from 50m away, bind a keyboard button to Fire (to prevent accidental mouse movements), and shoot 1 bullet at a time, waiting for recoil to fully reset... Your single shot will land in a random spot.

Shoot 50 times and you'll have almost 50 different bullet holes (or however many can exist before they disappear, you get the picture).

When you finish, bring the bullseye close to you at 5m again and you can see just how wide the RNG is for the first bullet. 

In fact, you can test this on the actual target dummy at 50m

Just aim at his head perfectly on center and then do the same test. Not all of your bullets will even hit his head.

This RNG will translate into the game over time and people with bad luck will have streaks of occasions where their 100% accurate shots are missing completely, leading to unfair advantages due to RNG

We can argue that the RNG is  fair because everyone has to contend with it, but that's not how skill based games such as this should work in my view.

I understand many will argue and say ""get good"" but you're missing the point entirely. It isn't about how good you are, it's about the fact that there is a 100% RNG element to your first bullet and you will regularly be in situations where you should have landed a headshot but it went right past their ear even though you aimed 100% accurately.

I'm pretty happy with how Viper's wall change made her a lot more viable, but it seems like the main issue with Viper is the fact that she is simply unable to redeploy the wall for retakes. My proposed idea to help counteract this could be to divide Viper's wall in half.

This would allow her to be able to use one wall in pre-round for whichever site she's on, and then have a secondary wall for retakes. I think this could turn her into a very potent attacker and defender because she would now be able to cut off two sizeable lines of sight, allowing her team to be able to get site control by splitting up the enemy team's vision with her walls.

Using Bind A as an example, she could still theoretically have her wall control both sites on defense if she quickly set both up, but if she only set up A, after a potential sage wall plant by Truck, she could use her second wall to cut off Lamps and deny attacker's which hold there any sight.

&amp;#x200B;

Logistics may be confusing with two walls, considering currently the wall is

E - Place - Activate - Deactivate

But a possible solution could simply be to use F as the activator for the walls.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Allow us to place bots from the Practice Range in custom games and respawn them in the cheats menu.

Custom Games really need the ability for players to place immobile bots.  Being able to test lineups, practice prefiring and aiming on actual maps, and generally learning more about the game without having lots of friends or alternate accounts.


I know that full bot AI is likely low priority due to other issues and qualities, but being able to place the bots from the practice range in custom games, choose their difficulty, and respawn them via menu options should be a quick stopgap measure.

Currently, the best way to do anything similar to this is to go into a game with a friend playing sage, kill them over and over and have them resurrect where the enemies may be, but this still creates issues with respawning and doesn't create anything close to a ""real-game"" situation.",VALORANT,Bots in Custom Games like in Practice

Now, people have been talking about adding ranked rewards for a very long while, I'm not sure if they'll ever be available, but if they do I really hope that something like this can be possible since it's a smaller thing that people won't throw games for, or only play ranked for only for gun buddies, just a simple addition that enhances the experience for people already playing.

##[Here's what it would look like in game](https://imgur.com/qFv3tn5)

Maybe Player cards, Radianite, and card texts could also be cool, I feel like these lower tiered rewards would work very well and be highly commended, it would also make ranked feel a lot nicer, while adding content.

503,snakecyclops,1594781550,hrfo3v,302,63,"I just came off a Bronze ranked game and for the umpteenth time had a player or group of players blatantly make racist remarks against me. 

I am from India but live in Canada, moved here not very long ago and I have a distinct Indian accent. I am active on voice chat regardless and keep making short useful call outs about where enemies are etc. the usual stuff. I come from Overwatch and I did the same in that game too.

In most of my Valorant games this is welcomed and seldom even appreciated. But very very frequently, especially in Unranked mode, I have people make fun of my race, my accent, or downright tell me I don't belong here etc. 

I am an adult in my 30s and my immediate reaction is to tell them to stop (To be honest I do get angry on occasion) and then mute them if they continue and then report them. I am not sure if reporting helps in terms of action taken.

Insults range from mimicking the accent (not playfully I am on board with that), saying I belong to tech support, ""You know you are the wrong servers, right?"" to even blatantly calling names.

I have experienced some of this in Overwatch too but the sheer number of incidents in the one month of Valorant is alarming. The most depressing aspect is most of these comments are made by kids way way younger than me, some sound like they are not even out of lower grades of school yet.

I know I can avoid some of this by not solo queuing. But that is not the answer! I want to play the game on my terms.

TLDR: Here is my take on this and my reason for this post, I am strong enough and old enough to deal with this but we as a gaming community need to safeguard fellow gamers especially younger ones from this menace. If you see any body being racially abused on either team, ""Speak Up!"". I have not had a single teammate come to my aid on these various instances in Valorant. Also, Riot should make sure these reports are taken seriously and some feedback on action taken be sent back to the person(s) reporting. I also suggest adding a separate category if required. In the climate we live in and Black Lives Matter movement etc. I am shocked at the state of mind of the younger generation on the NA servers at least.

I created my Riot Games account and played my first game of Valorant 2 days ago, on July 12th. Really enjoyed the game, played a match the first night and then another two last night.

Today I logged in and found that my account had been permanently banned.

This was surprising to me, considering that I played three only matches and... haven't cheated.

Contacted customer support. They said that they scanned my account and found evidence ""related to the usage of scripts, hacks, exploits, or unauthorized third-party programs"".

I don't do any of this- I click on people and throw fireballs and junk. And I was having a great time too!

Customer support also said they couldn't disclose any information about my case, in the fear that I'm some kind of bot trying to get info on how cheaters get taken out of the game, and the ticket was closed.

I don't pirate crap, I do use Discord and I have NVIDIA GeForce installed which both try to use an overlay- but I can't imagine this would get me perma-banned.

Obviously, this is pretty upsetting, and I know I can't truly prove on here that I haven't been cheating but I've come to you, Reddit, because I don't really have any other options. Any ideas on why this might have happened/what I can do now? I'm really bumming out.",VALORANT,"Brand New Player, Perma-banned for no reason - help?"

Every game comes down to who can OP better at this point in most of my games. If you somehow end up without enough smokes you are basically screwed. Even then countering the OPs is super difficult in solo queue because trades are much less common than pro play, even in diamond/immortal games since people don’t like to be the bait. 

Personally I would like the op to be 6000, as that would drastically reduce the amount in game. If I could have my way there would be no op in the game but I know that won’t fly. It’s just not fun to play again and it’s ruining the game for me and I’m sure many others. 

I would like to add it’s also very easy to use despite it having a high skill ceiling. I’ve played a few games on my friends account who is gold, just to take a break from the current op meta and I’ve died to people who have no business killing me just because they have an op.

• Combats smurfing: Good high elo players HAVE to still keep playing on their main accounts otherwise they might miss out on the end rewards.

• Combats toxicity/afk: I have seen plenty of posts on here of riot punishing people for 1hour+ for being afk/toxic. Again, encourages people to not afk/toxicity so they can actually play and get exp.

• Makes the end rewards more prestigious: This kind of comes down to human psychology, but we enjoy rarer/prestigious things. A lot of people have the kingdom spectre skin. When I pick it up, I couldn’t care less. When I pick up the Exe dot vandal, that looks cool ASF. If everyone had the vandal skin at level 5, I eventually would also not give a fuck same as the kingdom spectre. 

Another example: All the rappers wearing gucci belts, looked cool initially. Now drug dealers and wannabes wearing them, looks trash now.

• If you cannot finish the BP, you still get your moneys worth: As long as you reach level 45 which is doable as calculated in other posts with 1-2 hours a day. You still get 12skins for £10. And thats not including 100 radiant points (worth £90) and all the other cosmetics.

• Makes you better at the game: The more you play, the better you get. Win-win for both you and riot.",VALORANT,Reasons why a BP should be a grind:

I’ve a lot of posts about people complaining about the ranked system and I thought nah it’s not that bad after climbing easily from bronze 2 to silver 3 mostly by destroying every game but  now I feel like the teams get really unbalanced...

Almost every game the enemies get gold players while my team has only silvers or even bronze players in it and mostly the teamwork/tactical skill of my enemies feels far superior to my own team. 

After now a 7 lose streak (where I’m almost always team MVP still)  I dropped to silver 2 again and I’m feeling to wonder if I’m the problem because I don’t hard carry every game? Did my MMR got higher than it should be after winning a lot of games? 

Anyways I don’t care much about the ranks since it will increase again and I’m getting better everyday but I would love to play games where I don’t have the pressure to clutch almost every round just to have a chance at winning.

Now, it is pretty straightforward that if one wants to be a good SOVA, I’ll have to put in the hours to learn the lineups, even the basic ones.

I’m all up for it, but, i think it will take a solid month or so, to build it up.

Just to be clear, I KNOW I am not the best player or even the top 15% but I've had nothing but a horrible experience as a solo player since playing Valorant with ranked mode. I understand it's a team based game, but these are such heavily skewed results it's not even fair.

One other consideration: If you are getting blown out, how are you supposed to perform? Seriously? Other than being a star studded smurf player playing out of your mind to what... lose 11-13?

BUT WHY is this ranked mode working the way it is? Does anyone else have this experience? Shouldn't it be like ""here's a slightly better than average Diamond team for you to not constantly derank from your D2 placement?""

I'd screenshot the other games but unfortunately it only goes back this far, previously I'd lost 7 in a ROW after that last win at the bottom there.

I connected back on the VPN and I made another account that is brazil region. Now that works, I can play games with him. We played and it was fun.

I'd like to discuss a problem I encounter more than frequently. Since I can't see every aspect of it I would love for you to discuss it with me and help me resolve it. I'm sure you all have some inputs on this issue, pro and cons, and can help me determine if this is a really bad idea or just not a fully thought concept. 

The question is **whether or not a game with a DCed player should count, and if so should it weight as much as a normal game on your MMR ?** 

I'm a bit tilted right now, but I'm convinced not : the player DCed should have a penalty but the player staying should have a decrease of MMR loss, due to playing a game way harder than expected.

But i'm sure there is downside to such an idea, and I'm wondering what they are and if they justify the non-implementation of such a system.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the story of what happened and why I'm so tilted ^(because I need to vent) , but it's irrelevant to the discussion so feel free to skip. Although, **this story also explain why I'm certain no such system is in place** in Valorant right now : 

I'm stating that because yesterday I lost two games due to dc, which made me unrank from Plat3 (probably close to diamond since I was in a win streak) to Plat1 in not more than three games. The first one was due to the server bug that happened yesterday evening in EU, which disconnected three player in my team including me, and none in the other. I succeded to join the game in the last round, just to watch three of my teammates struggling to handle a 3v5. Since the game was supposed to be in our favor (some golds in the enemy team, so higher overall MMR for us), and we lost 5-13, I got deplated to plat 2. I would consider this unfair for two reason : first we were winning 5-0 but we lost due to a server bug. Second, I'm sure my teammates didn't deserve such a hard loss. I won the game after that but there's nothing to tell here (I do have to admit I was underperforming though) . I then lost a second game where my teammates decided to rundown without shooting after our Brim decided to insult all of us and RQ after only 3 round lost in defence. The thing is, had he not RQ we could have won this, or at least not lose at 3-13. But he did, we lost the game hard, and I got once again deplated to Plat1.

&amp;nbsp;


Background: In Beta I placed in Gold 1 and was able to rank up to Diamond 2. For Act I, I went 3-2 in placements and was placed in Plat 3. After 36 games, I was able to hit Immortal with a 58% Win Rate. I have a lot of experience with FPS Games, mainly CS:GO and Overwatch. 

&amp;nbsp;

Gameplay Tips &amp; Knowledge


&amp;nbsp;

**Aiming**

* Great aim comes with experience and building muscle memory. The basics of having good aim is ensuring you are used to your in-game sensitivity and dpi and maintain crosshair placement to be at head level. I would recommend going into the practice range and start with achieving a perfect score on easy mode and then achieving a perfect score on medium. There is enough delay between each bot that will help you get in the habit of adjusting your aim after you flick to the next target. Personally, on hard mode I usually score around 17-24. 
* Another thing I noticed is that I should be holding wider angles instead of close angles to a corner. For some reason, many players decide to wide swing instead of jiggle peeking when turning a corner or wall. 
* There are many guides out there that goes more in-depth into aiming, personally I would recommend Ron “Rambo” Kim’s content to get a better understanding of aiming. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Team Compositions**

* Team comps are very important as you approach into higher ranks. This is mainly due to the operator meta. Having Sage and Cypher are usually a must, along with a brimstone or an omen, and then filling in the rest with an additional control agent or two duelists. Games where you have 3 or 4 duelists become way more difficult because you don’t have the utility to defend a site or block off angles. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Utility Usage**

* Use your utility effectively and make sure you don’t waste it. After having to play sage for almost 50% of all my competitive games, I learned how important saving utility is. 
* On defense, utility is used to slow down the enemy and waste their time. The amount of times I’ve seen a sage just throw down her wall randomly or use both slow orbs at the beginning of the round is too high. 
* On offense, utility is used to gain control the map. Don’t smoke or molly or slow chokepoints &amp; areas that your team needs to push. Even at higher ranks I see this happening often. 
* Another example: on the Map Split, on defense side I like to peek mid from mail room. After my first shot I run back, however the enemy team usually adapts to this and will rush me the moment I fire my shot. Instead of just running away or trying to place a wall down, I would place a slow instead and re-aim while moving backwards. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Eco Rounds &amp; Round after Pistol**

* Eco Rounds are always winnable: I believe the shorty has such a huge impact in this game. For 200 credits, you can disrupt the opponents economy by securing at least 1 kill. If you play with the shorty correctly, you can even win the round if you are able to get a kill and secure a better gun.
* I always communicate to my team to be careful of the enemy team being aggressive or playing close angles when their eco is bad. Make sure to either play default or together. 
* The second round after pistol round is also very important. This round is played out in several different ways: losing team could force buy, players can go light armor with phantom/vandal, everyone goes full armor bulldog, winning team keeps ghosts and goes full armor, losing team goes all shorties. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Winning &gt; Personal Performance**

* After playing many ranked games, winning games with round differences is more important than your personal performance. There is a difference in playing aggressive, where you can surprise the enemy verse hunting for kills which ends up with you feeding.
* One of the biggest mistakes I have seen is where the attacking team is able to eliminate two people and secure a site and plant the spike, but botches up the post plant hold since they decide to chase after the remaining enemies and lose duels one by one which ultimately loses the round. 


&amp;nbsp;

**Trading Kills &amp; Baiting**

* Stop baiting your teammates and learn to trade kills. If your team is pushing, don’t stand 20 feet behind them, you should be able to fight the enemy almost immediately after your teammate engages with them. 
* If you play a duelist, **and I emphasize:** most of the time, you should be going in first. Even in Diamond, I have had reyna’s and phoenixes wait for their teammates or me (who is usually playing sage or a control character) to go in first. Your duelist character has utility designed to entry frag, don’t be scared to go in.  


&amp;nbsp;

**Toxicity &amp; Tilting**

* Toxicity exists at all ranks but try your best to have a positive mindset and try not to get tilted. 
* In one game, my team had a reyna that ended up going 6-26 and was complaining all game about how he’s unlucky and getting running headshotted all the time. Our whole team tried to keep a positive mindset and told him that its okay and to just play with the team, but he was adamant on how stupid the game was and would continue to lurk and die. Luckily the game ended in a draw.
* However on the opposite end, I had a game where I made a huge blunder during the pistol round where I forgot to heal myself and missed several bullets on the opponent and lost the round. One of my teammates stated I was “braindead” and was the worst player that he ever played with. Up to this point, there was no flaming and toxicity that occurred over 12 rounds so far. I got angry and fired back stating that he is playing an entry fragger and he only has 2 kills more than me. We both were angry and just shut up and focused on the game when the next round started. We both started racking up kills and I gave him heals when he requested them and we were able to pull a win from a 5-9 scoreline to 13-9. 

&amp;nbsp;

**DATA/STATS**

* Including my placement matches, I played a total of 36 games. My win percentage is 58.3% where I won 21, Lost 14, and had one draw. I played 29 games in Patch 1.2 and 7 games in Patch 1.3. 
* My average placement on the scoreboard is 4.89, I was MVP twice when I played Raze and was at the bottom two times and that was when I was playing Sage. 

Across 36 Games: 

* I played a total of 778 rounds where I won 420 of them and lost 358. I had a total of 613 kills, 550 deaths, and 239 assists (which is 1.11 KD) and I averaged 17 kills, 15 deaths, and 6.6 assists per game. 
* My average Combat score is 228, Average econ rating is 37, Average KD is 1.2, Average Damage per Round was 134.27 and Average Kill Per Round was .8. 
* My average game time was 38 Minutes and 11 seconds, with the shortest game being 26 minutes and 18 seconds (score line was 13-3) and my longest game was 52 minutes and 4 seconds with a score line of 14-14. 
* For agent specifics: I played Sage 17 times with a win rate of 53%. MY best agent is raze where I have a 70% win ratio with her over 10 games. 
* I had a total of 90 first bloods, died first 63 times, and was the last to die 72 times. I also defused the spike 8 times and planted it 70 times. 
* My average headshot percentage was 11%, bodyshot percentage was 80% and legshot percentage was 9%. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Overview**

For my placement matches, I went 3 and 2 and placed in Plat 3. Going from Diamond 3 to Immortal took the same amount of games it did to go from plat 3 to diamond 1. One thing I found out is that you will always be shown 1 down arrow when you lose a game. Even with a scoreline of 1-13 or 11-13, your progress isn’t clear. 
The hardest part was trying to rank up in diamond since I would alternate between a win and loss.  from Diamond 2 to Diamond 3, it took me 4 wins where 3 of those games I was able to get 3 green up arrows. 

There is a lot of discussion ongoing and I agree with the general consensus that it would be nice if we can see our progress more clearly, I would be fine if it was similar to TFT. I would also like to see a top 500 leaderboard or something similar to challenger &amp; grandmaster in league. 
In general, I believe Riot has done a good job with matchmaking and keeping the teams balanced in competitive. I had the occasional game where it was a blow out, but overall most of the games were very close and sweat fests. 

I definitely see a huge difference in my style of play as well as skill level from when I first started in Beta to where I played my first placement matches to where I am now. Hopefully this video/post provides useful information to you and brings some insight into ranked at a higher level.

Windows Game Mode also seems to help with the FPS actually, despite common sentiment.

I never really had this problem until patch 1.01 came out.

so I've recently picked up the game again after only having played the beta and my friends and me were really surprised that the RNG when it comes to the map choice in competitive seemingly still has not been fixed. Out of our 5 games we needed to get a rank we played Split 4 times. After that we played 4 maps of Bind. I completely forgot  that Haven was even a thing and we didn't even get to try out the new map which doesn't seem right.

After that I read on the ""Ask-Valorant""-thing this week that they don't plan to implement a map-choice-queue like CSGO does with the reasoning that they don't want to split the playerbase and have longer queue times than needed. I really have to ask - Riot: are you aware you only have 4 maps? There's no playerbase to split over those. When Split came up the 4th time yesterday my friends and me were already settled to quit the game after the map. It's not even because we were mad or anything, we were just bored. Imagine playing 80 rounds straight on one map...

I want to list a few brainstormed suggestions here to maybe fix this:

You could make players who have played a map multiple times in a row a ""priority"" and have the RNG not pick that map again. Say 5/10 players in a lobby have played Split 4 times out of their last 5 matches. Split will then be banned for that lobby without telling the players. The parameters for this could be easily tuned.

With a system like the one in CSGO, you could have it that to play ranked, players have to select at least 2/3 maps to start the queue. This wouldn't split the playerbase because the intersections would always be large enough to ensure short queues. 

You could let players ban 1 map when a lobby has formed so after playing a map 3 times your premade team can at least make sure that SOME variety is gonna happen.

In Quake Champions players are presented with 3 randomly picked maps which they can then vote on. This would have to be experimented with but I'd say it would be at least more unlikely to play a map 4 times in a row.

The last 3 options are especially interesting to me because riot would also get data on which map players like best/least. At this moment they only have this sub and maybe a forum somewhere to fall back on because the ingame map choice is random. But letting all players vote on their favourite maps would help them identifiy which maps need work.

Feel free to share more ideas or tear mine apart because I didn't think about them hard enough :p",VALORANT,Map choice in competitive queue

Edit:

&gt;For *Rated* matches flag players as ""no-Mic"", ""no-VoIP"" and ""normal""(?) and put them in a queue which matches their flag, then over time move them to higher ""tier"" queues (no-VoIP lowest, normal highest), maybe check online player count to calculate when to move a player to a higher ""tier"" queue, also put no-Mic players to 4 stack queues first.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't see why would it be a bad idea to match no-VoIP players of the same MMR. They don't lose anything with this while players who can use voice chat will have a higher chance of getting teammates who communicate over voice chat.

Thank you for all the support on my [Viper post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hpgz6p/i_bodypainted_myself_into_viper_not_brave_enough/)! This week I bodypainted myself into Reyna and it made me feel so badass!

I hope you enjoy and please let me know if you have any suggestions for future characters! I'm currently considering Sage but open to new ideas! 😊

https://preview.redd.it/vzgc24o1zob51.jpg?width=1556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ca85e62e33c432917c3a2c868df235aa20fd496",VALORANT,You guys seemed to like my Viper bodypaint so here's my attempt at Reyna!
809,breathelikeatree,1595106412,hto7ik,54,161,"So I heard riot is thinking of nerfing/buffing certain agents, and what better agent than brim daddy. Implementing these 6 buffs will create a more balanced agent in the queue. 

1. Brim has a backpack which is used for his utility, but I believe that this should allow him to carry multiple weapons he finds on the ground, not just the three he has currently. These weapons should be instantly equipable in the middle of a game, and he doesn’t lose them when he dies. 

2. I also feel like brims ULT is very imbalanced. In order to balance it out, I believe that if he uses his ULT on the spike, it should melt it into oblivion, resulting in an automatic win for his team. I also believe he should be able to use it whenever he wants because he is *the* brim daddy. 

3. His molly is also super underwhelming. He should have an unlimited supply that he can launch into every corner. Once a player touches it, it should signal an alert on his wrist causing it to instantly burst into flames, engulfing and killing the enemy. (Only person immune to this is the brim daddy on the other team, just to make it a little more fair &amp;amp;lt;3) he will simply be left at one hp. 

4. His smokes. I believe that his smokes, when entered, should cloud the enemies vision with dust. As they leave, they should begin to cry from the pain and have their screen fogged up with tears, making it impossible to hit head shots or use abilities. 

5. brim daddy’s suit. He is wearing very thick armor, I believe this means he should be immune to all body and leg shots from every gun. He should be knife immune too and block all damage from agent abilities. This will result in enemy agents having to bow down to him in defeat and beg him for mercy to throw the game, which of course he won’t because he is *the* brimstone. 

6. Lastly, we can all agree brim daddy is the hottest agent in the game. Hes a sexc soldier. He’s the hottest agent that will ever exist. He can swoon anyone he comes across. I believe he should have a “winking” feature. This would cause any agent he crosses paths with to freeze and immediately faint after he winks at them, allowing him to swoop in for a kill. 


So yeah. These are just some *minor* buffs that will make brimestone a more fair agent to play. These buffs shouldn’t be too hard to implement and I hope I can see these in the next patch. I think I was a bit lenient here but let me know what you think!",VALORANT,Buff brim daddy

It would be nice if it actually covered its entire radius all the time and not stopping because of random terrain and weird environmental interactions that mess with its radius. But more importantly, what I think her ult REALLY needs is a quality of life change! Ie, when you are casting it and when it is active, it should SHOW allies the radius that it covers on the map. Because a lot of times when I cast the ult, only God knows what dimensions the ult covers. This fact alone makes Viper's ult INCREDIBLY difficult for you and your team to play around because no one has any idea what angles are being covered by it and what isn't. And that is my opinion why Viper's ult is a lot of the time is not considered very beneficial to your team.

But if Riot thinks the quality of life improvements to Viper's ult isn't enough for whatever reason, it would be nice if the damage on Viper's wall becomes more noticeable. Due to the nature of how decay damage works and how thin/ short of a time enemies are in the wall before they pass through it... Her wall might as well not have any decay because it is that non-noticeable.",VALORANT,Riot mentioned that viper will be buffed so here are my thoughts

820,RickChum,1595103230,htnb2j,8,62,"In no particular order I'm going to list off tactics or tricks or habits that I've noticed among players

- 1. **Baiting out utility by giving your position away, trading utility or other resources**

By giving away my position via shooting or movement, it's possible for the enemies to believe that there are more than just 1 person. This could lead to them using their utility. By shooting bullets into nothing can have a similar effect.

Trading utility. By smoking off chokes and common angles, it's possible to get enemies to waste utility in preparation of a push.

- 2. **Using your pistol/gun on destructible panels (Haven and Ascent)**

On Haven and Ascent, there are destructible panels that have 500 HP (idk if this is exact). After being destroyed the walls can be penetrated by bullets normally. Using your pistol to break these can help clear out common hiding spots. 

As an attacker on Haven, you can shoot the panels on Garage door. As a defender on Ascent, you can shoot the panels on B Link, Mid Link, Mid Connector, w/e you call it.

- 3. **Giving away your position by accident**

This applies to mostly Omen and Reyna and a lesser degree to Cypher. Omen and Reyna's flashes are shown on the minimap, on top of that, they come from the body out. This means that enemies can tell where a Reyna or Omen is by looking at the minimap. This can apply to Cypher, but only when his camera is activated. 

Stabbing with your Knife creates sound, so don't go randomly walking and stabbing as if it's quiet.

- 3.1. Related to point 3 but more of an it's own topic, **reloading a gun unnecessarily**. 

Most non-pistols can kill with less than 1/2 the clip, reloading can not only be dangerous by being vulnerable by reloading, but it can give enemies a general direction of where your position is.

- 4.  **If the spike is dropped and you have time, try to attack from a different angle**

I've seen many times where players stand for 30s holding an angle then walk in and take the 1v3. If you have time, try to attack from a different angle. Go for a loop around, go pick up that ultimate orb on the other side of the map, there are many things you could be doing instead of standing around.

- 5. **Predicting where and how the enemies will play**

I've often found myself trying to guess where and how the enemies will play the round. Works best for early rounds or against teams that like to rush. A common thing I've found is teams that lose round 1 usually won't rush that same site a second time, also, failing a rush usually leads to teams trying a different site. 

Adapting to the enemies playstyle is also important. If you know the enemies have been playing slow, try to space out your utility more or switch it up all together. For example, Brimstone likes to smoke at the start of the round, but you could delay that smoke a few seconds or maybe change where you place it. These small adjustments could throw off the enemies.

- 6. **Switch things up**

By switching your playstyle and where each teammates plays (Defender side) you can catch the enemies off guard. Some rounds try playing aggressive and others maybe super safe. Also by switch up where agents play can have a huge impact, not only is it a playstyle difference but the difference in agent abilities could secure you a round. Switch it up and see how things go.

- 7. **Practice using pistols**

Everybody understands that it's fundamental to learn the general spray pattern of the rifle and controlling it at a distance, but just as important are the pistols. You start every game and half using pistols, winning the first round can secure an additional 3 round afterwards. Learning to shoot slower and controlling the aim of pistols are important too!

Unrelated to pistols but to Pistol Round, if you're not the best aimer, try buying players that are your entry fraggers or top fraggers a pistol instead. This way they can afford Light Shield and maybe additional abilities. You just sit back and let them carry

- 8. **Bad callouts are worse than no callouts. Make good callouts or make none at all**

I'm definitely guilty of this one. Making bad calls can lose your team the round. False or bad information is damaging to the team because it could cause them to overrotate or maybe make them unable to hear something or can cause doubt of their own decisions. You're better off being quiet then being loud and wrong. 

Some good callouts are:

You have 6 shots left.

X enemy player was last seen at X location.

X enemy player has no more (utility, flashes, smokes, molly, ammo, etc)

X enemy player has ult, watch out.

I have no more (utility, flashes, smokes, molly, ammo, etc).

- 9. **If your team is saving, save. If your team is buying, buy.**

You can lose rounds by not communicating your intentions with your econ. Giving the enemy team a Phantom on round 2 while all your teammates have Ghost can easily throw the round. Buying an Op while all your teammates are stuck on pistols probably will left you broke on the next round and the enemy team with an extra Op

These were most of the things I could list off the top of my head. Are there some things you disagree on? I'd like to hear about it.

- 10. **If you have time, plant more in the open**

There are better plant spots than default. Plant in a spot that can be held from more angles",VALORANT,Here's a bunch of small tactics that I've picked up on
821,alhyn,1595100700,htmkgo,47,57,"This game is free, yes we know this. We don't care if you're friends are low ELO. I am seeing solo queue smurfs left and right. What is the drive?

Watching my low ELO friends stream, I'm seeing people that could compete with me? Are people that scared to lose their rank that it's genuinely  detrimental to your mental health? I can tell you, if you have to smurf to feel good at the game, you need to find a new hobby. Just practice, get better, and play competitive at YOUR ELO. It ruins the game for the lower ELO players, and drives them away from the game. Even worse, you're toxic to players who aren't as good as you. They didn't ask for a smurf to be there.

826,Pruvided,1595101009,htmnr6,136,34,"###Hello everyone! I hope some of you have had the chance to leave ideas for the subreddit on our [Feedback Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hl4rtm/state_of_the_subreddit_feedback_thread_1/). If you haven't, it is something we still encourage users to check out. Based off some community feedback we will be addressing some new rules/additions.
###These rules will not count retroactively, any posts that are currently up will not be removed under these rules, only posts created after this announcement will be enforced under these rules.

Firstly, we are implementing a 100 character minimum for all text posts. We have noticed that the majority of posts with low word count fall under our ""no low-effort"" rule. This rule is aimed at creating more meaningful discussions by requiring users to go a little more in depth with their topic by being more descriptive.

This rule will be an addition to our current ""[**No low-effort submissions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/about/rules/)"" rule:

&gt;All text submissions must have a 100 character minimum in the body text. Posts that only consist of short title references like ""Title"", ""That is all"", ""\^"", etc will be removed.

---

We've noticed a lot of cases where there has been confusion regarding the application of some of our rules. We have made a few clarifications regarding Direct Address, Private Individuals, and Spam/Self-Promotion to hopefully make them clearer.

With our direct address rule, there have been many occasions where users do not know why their post was removed. This subreddit is designed for users to talk with the community and not a forum to directly talk to Riot. This rule is specifically meant to target posts such as ""Dear Riot, Please add \_\_\_\_ to the game"", but there are still more subtle ways to directly address Riot that we will remove posts for. Riot is active in the community and will often comment on a thread. We are currently working on finding a good way to highlight Riot responses on threads while also allowing them the freedom to casually interact and not feel the need to always answer with a ""professional"" response.

This rule will be an addition to our current ""[**No Direct Address**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/about/rules/)"" rule:

&gt;Some common words and phrases that are considered direct address include: ""Please add/change/fix"" and ""Can we add/get/fix.""

---

In [our previous set of new rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/gz6r5g/new_rules_clips_stream_promos_and_private/), we introduced the concept of private individuals and banned posts explicitly calling out such individuals. Given that there was some (admittedly understandable) confusion about who qualifies as a private individual, we will be adding the following section to our current Private Individuals rule:

&gt;Private individuals are those who do not place themselves in public view by way of content creation or media presence. This could include methods such as videos, articles, humor, etc.

An important consequence of this definition is that high elo players (even Radiant players) are also classified as private individuals, unless they stream/create videos/etc. This means that posts calling out high elo players must be censored unless they are public individuals.

As a reminder, this subreddit is not the place to report some random cheater in your ranked games. **If you encounter a cheater in any rank, you can report them using the in-game report feature as well as creating a ticket at Riot support with proof of said cheater.**

---

Our spam/self-promotion rule has previously been laid out in terms of percentages, but, we've decided to move from the current vague definition of 10% to the following ""[**Spam/Self-Promotion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/about/rules/)"" rule:

&gt;Do not spam; no more than 3/25 of your last submissions on Reddit should be self-promoting content.

&gt;Excessive spam is not allowed. Self-promotion is allowed as long as the content is relevant to VALORANT and does not break one of the other rules. You may only self-promote if at least 23 of your last 25 posts/comments are organic discussion on all of Reddit.

This change creates a *slightly* less strict ratio as well as hopefully makes it clearer for users to know when they are breaking the rule.

In a few weeks I'll get a perfect new connection though.

Well actually I already played Splatoon 1&amp;2 and Fortnite before Valorant, but that was also super casual and on a Switch, so everyone was stuck with 60 fps.

Valorant is the first shooter I'm playing with a Mouse instead of a controller with motion control and my aim is, as to be expected, underwhelming.

It's not the PC that is forcing me to play with 60 fps btw, but my monitor that only has 60 Hz. It's a 4k photo editing monitor from my father so response times are pretty bad too.

In addition to the new internet I'm also thinking about buying a new Monitor for myself. 

Do you think my aim will improve with a good 144 Hz (QHD) monitor? Will I still suck? Do I just have to get used to playing with a Mouse first? Am i retarded for even expecting decent aim under these circumstances?

I'm not that great of a player (Silver 2 in CS, low Gold/high Silver in Valorant) and I don't play every day, but when I do trying to deal with the negative mental aspects of the game has been really challenging for me. I'd love to hear how other people manage it. The ranking system seems to be pretty fluid, which is great when I'm ranking up but incredibly stressful when I'm doing poorly. I haven't played consistently since last week, but I was on a hot streak (went from Silver 2 to Gold 1 in a few days) after winning or losing (a close one while top fragging) a few games in a row, and I was feeling pretty good about it. I picked up the game today, lost the first game, and instantly deranked to Silver 3. I know it shouldn't matter to me, but losing and deranking sucks, and when I consider myself to be playing poorly it really affects how I play and how I think while I'm playing. I start worrying that I'm going to derank, that I'm not actually supposed to be in Gold and that it was a fluke, etc.; basically just doubting and criticizing the hell out of myself. It makes playing close games way more stressful than it should be (instead of fun). Tilting sucks, but it seems like when I'm in a rut mid-game I quickly get stuck in a downward spiral. This isn't so much a problem in CS (I've been Silver 2-3 for a few hundred hours now) so I don't really care, but the fluidity of ranks in Valorant makes it seem much more pressing. Does anyone have some mental strategies they've used to stop worrying so much? I love playing (even solo queuing!) but sometimes it seems like I've created a situation where I have to win or do well to have fun, and obviously that doesn't always happen.

846,tyrede0,1595111666,htpn0o,2,8,"Hey guys! So I feel like we all know that from all the agents, Viper is probably the one that feels the less powerful from the current roster. I had some ideas that could potentially make her a more valuable addition to a team. Keep in mind that I am in no way a professional so I might not know  everything about higher rank play style. So any way, let’s go through every abilities


C- Snakebite:


 In my opinion this is the ability that don’t really need any changes it is similar to brimstone molly or Phoenix’s fireball. Some people suggested that Viper should be able to walk through it without taking damage but I don’t really think that it is an issue 


Q- Poison cloud:


This is the ability I really would change. In essence this is just a smoke. Yes it does inflict decay but at a really slow pace and the health is regained rapidly. Therefore, if we compare it with other smokes available for other characters it’s easy to see how weak it is. First of all you need to have line of sight of where you want to throw it or at least be really near it. The only other character who needs that to place smokes is Jett and her whole kit revolves around going in and staying out of fire with her dash/jump. Compared to Brimstone or Omen smoke that you can place without putting yourself in danger Viper’s smoke are really limited. Even with the facts that you can activate/deactivate it at will, I feel like the fact Omen gets a new smoke that he can place anywhere on the map every 30 seconds and for free  is just way better. Even Brimstone has 3 smokes which basically means he could also smoke the same angle for a amount of time similar to Viper while also having the ability to put it anywhere else. I had a 2 ideas to make those smokes a little better.



Idea 1- keep the same decay and everything but make it so that Vipers vision when she enters the smoke orb is the same as the one we have under Omen’s smokes (seeing everything under the dome) while enemies are short sighted. That would make it really easier for the smoke to be a real threat as entering it with a Viper in it means you have a high chance of dying.



Idea 2- Make it so that enemies stay short sighted for a bit of time after getting out of the smoke. That would lead to some interesting on/off plays that would make the character more viable in my opinion.


E- Toxic screen


In my opinion the fact that they made the wall go through wall was really the good way to go as the problem with the toxic screen was the same as it now is with the orb, you had to put yourself in danger to put it down. So there is nothing else to change here I believe


X- Viper’s pit


As it is this ultimate isn’t useless, it can provide good cover for a spike plant and is a really good repellent for a push on a site if playing defense. But, again, when you compare it to other ultimates available in game it feels like it’s lagging behind. It basically is just a big smoke and the decay isn’t really fast enough to give any real advantage to Viper in most engagements. She also get no vision bonus except the red glow... which Reyna gets for the the whole map without being blinded... so here are my ideas to make it a bit more powerful:


Idea 1- Give a vision advantage to Viper

It could just be giving her vision in the smoke a slightly longer reach so that she can at least see the enemies before they do and make it so that her ult is actually advantageous for her and not just a big neutral smoke

I also saw a post suggesting that the ultimate could gradually lower the enemies vision up until they are concussed (like breach ultimate and abilities) 


Idea 2- Give Viper a damage advantage


I could see many way of doing this. They could potentially make it so that enemies that stay in the smoke get the “fragile” debuff so that Viper still has an advantage even if she sees the enemies at the same time they see her. However that would be very strong considering that means double damage from anyone and a decay debuff but if they change fragile to deal x1.5 damage or something of the sort it could be balanced and thematic considering Viper is the only one with access to ”fragile”. Another option could be to turn the decay inflicted in some sort of “poison” that would act the same as decay but be permanent damage. It could be something like dealing 99 damage overtime so it can’t actually kill a player but would be another advantage for Viper. They could even reuse the keyword for her snakebite... however in that case because of “fragile” poison could kill. That could lead to some plays with her ult coupled with her snakebite. The snakebite wouldn’t deal double damage since the poison effect would be applied only once but it would allow players to die of the poison.



So here it is guys, how to make Viper better in my humble opinion",VALORANT,Ideas to make Viper better
847,dmsw2m,1595112686,htpwp1,17,8,"I've been a little frustrated recently. I've been playing Valorant since the second beta, and while the game ran very smoothly back then, it's performance has been a CONSTANT downward trend. Despite the performance being absolutely awful on high end rigs for a good length of time, I've noticed that the devs have finally gotten their shit together, and sorted it out for the rigs that it shouldn't have been an issue for in the first place. Great, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But ever since these issues have been seemingly fixed, I notice that Valorant hasn't been getting any more patches for performance, like, at all. Despite almost none of the performance patches improving FPS for rigs that weren't high end, and despite saying they were going to continually optimize the game, my performance on both my rigs is just, unapologetically awful, with almost no end in sight.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For context, here's the min specs for 144 + frames, taken directly from [https://playvalorant.com/en-us/specs/](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/specs/)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i5-4460, and a 1050ti. For 144fps +. I have two rigs, one running a 8700k, and a 2070. While my performance there is more than acceptable, I'm not home near as often as I use to be, and as a result, I tend to play on my second rig more. My second rig has a i5 6600k, rx570, and 8 gigs of ram. Despite being more than enough to supposedly reach the 144+ min requirements, the amount of time where I'm actually maintaining this frame-rate is completely marginal. I tend to lock my frame-rate at 144 or 120 given the piss poor performance. But if I unlock it, I'll have highs into the 190-200s. With lows as bad as 80 to 90 fps. Even with the framerate locked, the screen tearing and frame drops are horrendous. With the average probably being around 104. Keep in mind, Valorant devs have even stated that they want performance benefits for lowering settings to be minimal, if not nonexistent. This performance is on the lowest possible settings. Everything at the absolute minimum. I'm talking 4x filtering, no anti aliasing, 720p resolution. lowest settings fucking possible. If I even try to turn textures on medium I'm looking at 90-100 fps average.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now keep in mind, on top of this, my performance in a custom lobby, or in the practice range, is incredibly smooth, with very little spikes overall. The issue, and piss poor performance almost only arrives when I'm in an online match with other players. Which, in my experience points to a CPU optimization issue.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a background in IT, and I promise you I've reset my PC, reinstalled Windows, reapplied thermal paste to my CPU and worked on air flow in my case. Despite all this, and the constant attempted workarounds each patch, Valorant is the only game that experiences these types of issues. I typically play Valorant with nothing open in the background, and even having discord running at the same time as Valorant shows massive increases in screen tearing and terrible performance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing else on my PC has this issue. Not Sea of Thieves, not Rust, not any of the other games I play, and definitely not one with spec requirements as low as this. I've seen users with the same CPU iterate the same issues. Users with similar specs iterate the same issues. This is not an issue with my specific PC, this is terrible optimization and it's actively keeping me from spending any real amount of time or money on the game as I can't even come close to actually enjoying it. I've heard of players in this subreddit with specs that are lower than this having 144fps CONSTANT. With almost no drops. I'm talking i3's and 1050ti's with constant 144. (according to them).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Riot has said they would keep working on these fixes, now that the most vocal part of the community isn't experiencing them they've all but forgone performance patches. They were more than happy to take the workload when players with 2080ti's and 9900ks were experiencing issues (because how could you optimize a bare bones game so poorly that the top 1% of PC's cant handle it despite having low-med requirements.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please. Just fix these issues. There's zero excuse for my current performance. I shouldn't have to pay top dollar for a secondary rig in the hopes that they'll acknowledge and actually tend to the issue. I've sent in tickets, I've posted in the bug threads. I get no reasonable or helpful responses. I just want to enjoy the game.",VALORANT,"Valorant's Optimization is Still Terrible, and No One is Talking About it."

853,GrantWardKilledDeath,1595103737,htng95,2,5,"Even after Viper buffs in patch 1.02, she still has a low pickrate and is generally agreed to be the weakest agent in the game.

Changes in 1.02 to Viper's Snakebite didn't fix the ability's issues. It still couldn't be used to clear corners or to stop a push as the fragile effect really didn't have that many opportunities to actually make a difference. I'd suggest removing the fragile effect altogether and instead buffing the DPS of Snakebite to around 70% of Brim's molly. 

Another key issue with Viper's kit is that her smoke abilities (poison orb, toxic screen, and her ult) is that pushing through her smokes doesn't harm the player because decay is practically useless.  I think the fragile effect would be better applied to her smokes. (x2 damage might be too much, but x1.5 seems reasonable) Decay and fragile should also linger on the player for a few seconds instead of immediately disapearing.

With things the way they are (I'm not going to summarize), not ONLY do Sage players have a more difficult time ranking up. They also have an easier time ranking down.

If I play a game as an Immortal 1 which includes Low Diamonds and Plat 3s, the ELO system is expecting me to have an exceptional game, which in its eyes is high KDA not including plants (I do all of them) and a variety of other important support tasks.   


Duelists and others have an easier time racking up a high KDA in such a game vs lower ELO people due to their abilities, and therefore have another hard advantage over Sage players.

Now, here are the four main tips I kept in mind during my ranked progression

1) The first thing you want to do is remove the V key from your keyboard. This is because talking in voice chat will distract your teammates and is a must-not. Instead, spam A, B, or C in the text chat whenever you see an opponent because the entire team is pushing you.

2) Agent selection: The most important part of this game is getting kills. Therefore you must always pick Jett, Raze, or Reyna. Practice selecting and locking in your agent in spike rush to make sure you always get who you want. A second tip is to press caps lock during agent selection and type ""SAGE PLS SAGE PLS"" in chat in order to guarantee a well rounded team. (Everyone needs a healer)

3) Crosshair placement: I have noticed repeatedly that in high ranks, like silver 1 and 2, player often make the mistake of aiming for the head, forgetting about recoil. Recoil is a feature that makes your bullets go up. To counter this, look directly at the floor at all times so that in any engagement your shots will hit the opponents head as recoil occurs.

4) Econ: many new player often make the mistake of buying guns like the phantom. vandal, and operator, along with their abilities. When purchasing these things, players forget that dying will mean they can only buy a pistol. To avoid this, get an stinger, ares, or marshall every round so that you will never need to use bad guns. Abilities aren't important, so don't buy and save cash. If you're feeling extra wealthy, try grapping a frenzy or a shorty to supplement your loadout.

If you buy it, then drop it and pick your classic back up, then once the round starts switch back to the shorty you can keep the classic. This lets you get the entry fragger kill and quickly pick up the loaded classic to possibly kill the player trying to trade you when they think you're reloading.

917,twdwasokay,1595177656,hu3oqv,214,193,"Very rarely do I leave a game I just lost and feel like I lost because of a map/character/OP. Everytime I lose I realize I made a lot of small/big mistakes that added up to a loss. Maybe as defenders we were playing mid too agressively so we gave the attackers free kills mid, or as attackers we gave up too much map control at the start so we were easily flanked. Maybe I didnt use my utility enough (omen main) to block off OP sight lines during pushes. 

This game can be maddening when your losing, the power level of some agents are insane especially when your opponents have the economic and morale advantage. At times it can feel like there’s nothing you can do, but there is always a way you can outplay your opponents. 

I realized at a certain point, If each mistake or death tilts me and I always blame the balancing/team mates/hit reg, I will never correct these mistakes and I will stay the same rank or even de rank. 

The best way to improve and climb on ladder is to stop and think after a loss. Was there anything I could have done better (aside from aiming)? Was there rounds I didnt use utility that I shouldve used? Do I have poor positioning on defense/post plant on attack? Am I not trading out my team mates when they die near me? Am I dying in places I cant get traded out? These are things I ask myself everytime I die or lose a game. It has allowed me to slowly climb out of silver, into gold and now Im teetering here at plat 1. I still have A LOT to improve on, but if you try and learn from every loss you will improve very gradually over time and your rank will follow. Blaming each loss on something other than my own gameplay will only hold me back from being the best player I can be. 

If a certain playstyle, agent or even just the Operator is giving you a really hard time then take the time and find out what you and your team can do to counter them. Theres thousands of tutorials on YouTube already for this game with many more being uploaded everyday! Focus on improving yourself and dont try and tell riot to fix split, nerf the op, or delete raze from the game. Focusing on something so out of your control will only serve to tilt you in game and you will never learn how to play around them. 

Sorry for the long post I just get really sad when I see people just destroying this game in text posts. I seriously believe this game has great hitreg (minus crouching hitboxes those seem busted rn), great agent balance and even better maps. 

If you are not having fun, take a break. Play a different game, go hangout with friends, take a walk. This game is incredibly tilting and it is totally okay to log off after a tilting loss streak. Come back with a fresh mind and some new info on how to counter that OPer or raze.",VALORANT,This game is incredibly balanced.

925,SupremeMemeRegime,1595171808,hu23ag,187,146,"I see all of these posts saying “Viper needs buffs!” And she does, just not for the reasons people think. People are complaining how her smoke isn’t as numerous and lasting and far-reaching as Omen’s or Brimstone’s. People groan about how her snake bite can’t kill anyone and people just push through it. That’s because Viper isn’t supposed to be played like Omen or Brimstone or Phoenix. When I play Viper, I focus on one thing. This word is literally in her description. Mindgames.

Viper’s screen is definitely the best ability Viper has. It has huge map coverage, and now that it goes through walls, it is absolutely her best ability. I haven’t heard anyone complain about the screen since the update, so instead of berating you for using it wrong, I’m going to elaborate on “mindgames.” The screen is great for pushing into a site without being shot at immediately, but when you use the screen, it’s kinda obvious to the enemy that you are pushing through. So instead, after using the screen to push through a site for a while, switch it up and use the screen to make the enemy think you are pushing that site and instead have your teammates attack another site. This should at least convince some of the enemy team to stay and watch the site the screen is at.

Viper’s smoke is not great at blocking sight lines. It can’t be thrown very far with precision, and you only have one. So stop trying to use it to block sight lines! (In most cases, her screen can block most if not all sight lines anyway.) Use it to discourage pushing through certain areas or to conceal yourself or both! To those who say the smoke doesn’t last long and takes forever to recharge, Viper gets the ability to decide how long her smoke lasts. Turn it off early to give the enemy the false impression that it won’t turn on for a while, then turn it on again as soon as possible to catch them off guard. Also, if you are hiding inside it, you can actually take advantage of the decay mechanic and boombots basically can’t see you. They have driven past me so many times in Vipers smoke without noticing me at all.

Viper’s snake bite is weak. It doesn’t deal as much damage as Phoenix’s and Brimstone’s abilities, so oftentimes people will ignore it and move over it. Small brain vipers say “darn.” I say “Yes!” Vipers snakebite inflicts a debuff on anyone standing on it to take DOUBLE DAMAGE! Combined with their health draining, if you shoot at them while they are standing on it, they will disintegrate. This forces them to stand their ground on the acid, or to move off while you are still shooting. You can also use the snake bite on people that are around corners, but that’s pretty obvious.

Viper’s ult has very mixed feelings, so all I will say is that if you use the ult, make it hard for people to find you. Don’t stand at the edge unless you intend to peek outside. If they travel to the deep part of Viper’s ult, they are decaying a lot. The longer it takes to find you, the more the fight will be in your favor.

TL;DR: Stop using Viper like other agents. Use her abilities as mindgames and strike while they are trying to pass through them.",VALORANT,People don’t use viper right

Your aim as sage is to support the team, not hunt for kills. On attack, the ideal position is to be at the back of a push so that you won't be dying first, and also not to be watching the flank as you need to be in a position to heal your teammates. When your team pushes, toss the slow orbs at common angles/choke points.

On defence, hold any angle passively and be prepared to slow orbs or wall off if you spot a rush coming. Alternatively, you can play from the back of a site, and be the rotating player, giving heals to whoever needs them and delaying a push with your skills.

Ideally, your kills should be coming from trades, and from retakes or holding the bomb plant. Don't be disheartened to have little kills on a stomp, that means the entry fraggers are doing their job. Alternatively, you can judge your performance based on your deaths.

934,ILikeMyEggsInABowl,1595134379,htuyob,495,93,"I don't want this to sound like a rant. It's not, it's really just me issuing some facts. 

You can call me bad, or whiney, or whatever you want. But anyone plat or above knows: **THE AWP IS WAY TOO GOOD**

&amp;#x200B;

There is little to no counterplay against the AWP. Flashes are far and few between, and often don't last long enough to make any real difference. That's the reason it's good, not amazingly outrageously meta in CS.

The fact that Jett, a bad character, is a good character ONLY because of her ability to use the AWP, is really the most glaring piece of evidence. 

It's absurdly frustrating to be an amazing rifler and be outclassed at all ranges but 5m (This is not me, not an amazing anything tbh). 

It needs to be nerfed for the overall longevity of the game. It's boring to see every match play out the same. (Not to mention how funny it would be to see all the players dip to gold once the crutch weapon gets nerfed)

In fact, I can tell you the exact way a game plays out all the way up to low immortal (Can't vouch for anything higher)

Win pistol round (optional) 

Save up money

Buy 2-3 phantoms/vandals, 2-3 awps

Hold angles on CT, or aggressively peek on T.

Win. Or lose if you are worse at aggressively peeking.

It takes very little skill to use this gun. All you have to do is have basically solid aim and learn it's movement parameters.  


Entire site holds are based around who holds the AWP.

It's a legitimate crutch.

&amp;#x200B;

Counter Strike doesn't have this to such a severe degree. The maps are set up different, and utility is more available, making team play an amazing counter.   


Valorant and CS should not be the same games, but CS has had a tried and true formula for simultaneous fun and competitive gameplay. And the main ingredient is definitely not the Valorant AWP.

Valorant is unique and has interesting gameplay, and I understand that it needs to flesh itself out. But this needs to flesh out soon.

The packet loss is occurring in what looks to be a router in Miami, Florida (  ae-8.a00.miamfl02.us.bb.gin.ntt.net)

Our network ends in Chicago, IL where it connects to the Internet in general. One of the traces looks fine and looks like results from a test I ran going into Chicago and terminating there to a Riot server. The other test that shows the packet loss goes to Florida and then to Riots servers.

Below is the trace with the packet loss. This trace is just how the internet routed him to his destination. The packet loss is occurring just before the hop in Florida to the Riot network
(104.160.151.130). That looks like an issue with the router Riot uses to connect to the internet (ae-8.a00.miamfl02.us.bb.gin.ntt.net).

I am not sure why Riot says it is his ISPs problem because they should know how the internet works in a general sense and the trace clearly shows the issue occurring at the router they are connected to. This is most likely due to over utilization of Riots server connection to the internet and everyone connecting to that server is having packet loss. I would guess that the packet loss only occurs during peak usage of the game and not in the middle of the morning or low usage times. This happens with many online games, especially when there is a new update and increased users of their services. If Riot had more bandwidth and less users, this packet loss would probably not be there. Getting a VPN would only change his IP, but probably not how the internet routed his traffic and certainly would not change the internet connection at the Riot server having the issue. We do not rate limit or hinder any traffic on our network based on where it is going, so to us, there would still be no loss or latency to the internet. Both of his traces show 10 ms or less for us with no loss.",VALORANT,Full response from my ISP regarding what Riot continues to claim is a ISP related issue to ping.

The fact that there isn't a ""favor the shooter"" mechanic and that hitreg is server-based instead of client overall just makes shooting less enjoyable. Why can't we have a client-first approach to hitreg and positions and then try to improve the netcode from there? This will make holding common angles even harder against prefire, but at least there is a hitreg consistency so we can focus on positioning and movement to improve our tactical play rather than bottleneck our aim due to the current server-client architecture.",VALORANT,"Peeker's Advantage, ""Favor the Shooter"", and Valorant's NetCode"

959,thenamedex,1595192283,hu80ci,82,27,"As the title says, these are a few small changes that in my opinion will make the game better and feel more polished. I will list them from most likely to happen to least likely.

1. **Add a accept/decline match option**

I think many people would really appreciate this. Currently when a match is found; you are automatically put into the game; forcing you to either play or to dodge the game which can give you a queue timer.

Sometimes; people accidentally click unrated when they want competitive, or vise versa; it is too late when they realize as they will already be sucked into their game.

League offers this option before any match starts; I do not see why it is not in valorant; this looks like a basic thing to have on a competitive game.

Furthermore; people might have something that comes up last minute; emergency or not; having that decline option helps to ensure players dont get punished for wanting to no longer play that match before it even begins.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Ability to choose maps**

Unrated should be a way to practice; its unrated for a reason; it does not count towards your competitive rank. Thus making it the best way to learn new agents and maps that you can practice and eventually bring to your competitive play. However; with the lack of the ability to choose which maps you want to play; it is pretty random in what map you get. Currently you have a 25% chance to get any map; there are 4 maps. So you have a 25% of getting the map you want to play and learn. If the map is called bind; you're gonna get that map every game.

Giving players the ability to choose which maps they want to queue for in unrated allows them to practice that specific map and get better at it.

3. **More experience points to unlock agents and finish the battle pass quicker**

There's a battle pass system; there's a system to unlock agents. Fairly easy, play a game and get xp; do the daily/weekly quests to earn more xp. However; this is not viable for everyone. It still takes a bit of a time for people to do the battle pass or to unlock an agent. Not everyone can spend their time everyday on valorant and certain people may not be able to play more than once a week. Make it easier to do the battlepass and easier to get agents.

I think it is important to be able to unlock agents without feeling like its tedious work. You just want to play the agent; you dont want to make it a chore to get it. Yes I know people get two free agents in the beginning but thats not enough for wanting to unlock others. If they are going to increase the amount of agents; they will need to make it easier to get.

Battlepass is takes a while to complete; thats fine. However it feels like it takes too much work than it needs too. An increase in xp would make this a lot better and easier.

4. **Make battlepass worth it**

The battlepass is not really worth much in my opinion; compared to other battlepasses in games; this one just feels so lackluster with basic/simple skins and other simple rewards like charms, titles, player cards and radiant points. Furthermore; unlike other battle passes; you cant complete the battlepass and have enough points to purchase it for the next season. Each season you need to spend $10 and so far it doesn't seem like the battlepass is worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Map creator**

Probably the least likely to happen; but a map creator would really help this game. One of the best features of CSGO is the community-made maps; even dust 2 was once made by a simple user of the community. I know they have some of the CSGO map creators making maps on valorant but each map feels similar.

In CSGO, since you had users from the community making maps; you had different styles, feels, ambitions for each map. Dust 2 doesnt play the same like cobblestone; it doesnt feel similar. Nuke is not like Train. Each map has some unique style and can be played differently.

Sure Mirage has some similarities like Dust 2, but they also established that Mirage's mid is not the same like dust 2 mid. There is clearly inspiration but you can tell it does not play the exact same

Having a map creator allows the community to bring variety of ideas and variety of maps that dont feel like they play the same. We can see new things; new mechanics and new playstyles. I'm sorry but I dont like being claustrophobic with every map I play

967,ConstantValorant,1595195401,hu8x0m,0,19,"In an exclusive interview with the [*YouTube*](https://youtu.be/o24k3dpok8g) channel Qwixzo, the creative director at Riot Games, David Nottingham, described the developer's plan on how they would tell *Valorant's* backstory. The lore of *Valorant* will mostly be delivered through character interaction and environmental elements, and Nottingham says the team has taken careful consideration to create layered personalities and motivations for all of the characters, which the team *""can kind of peel back""* throughout the game's lifetime. The type of world-building in *Valorant*, often referred to as environmental storytelling, has been seen previously in similar titles. [*Overwatch*](https://screenrant.com/tag/overwatch/) is a prime example of environmental storytelling, and from Nottingham's interview, the similarities between [Blizzard's](https://screenrant.com/tag/blizzard) approach and Riot's storytelling is obvious. On telling stories in this manner, Nottingham says, *""What's really interesting to me is seeing if that is something that players will engage with, get excited about, or offer their own theories.""* 

So the Lore is being revealed to us with environmental storytelling and by the agents voice lines themselves. And here we run into a Problem...

 whats the deal with the current 3 Atlas logos that can still be found in game in game... were they a past version of Kingdom Co?

So Atlas was a mistake: Now the problem with all of this is that ""Riot games"" told us that the lore will progress thru environmental storytelling and other than asking directly .... once something is removed from the game there is no way of knowing if it was just forgot there and removed because of that or if it was removed because the lore progressed.

(If Atlas was a Corporation in the Lore and we didn't know that it was kingdom and removed.... we could have thought that it was destroyed by something in the Lore and that would then have been the reason for its dissaperance + ""Necrit""(a YTber) did a lore video and he thoght Atlas was a thing so already we are having a hard time with this + myself)

which lead to another problem:

We are currently on patch 1.03 and one of the Voice lines that was in game was removed (I've downloaded all the games voice lines from the files and it got removed) and its Jetts voice line ""I hate that people think Venice is my Fault""... its no longer in the game.

https://reddit.com/link/hu8x0m/video/menq9evtuvb51/player

My question to you ""Riot Games"" (u/ProgRocktopus ) is can we considered removed Voice lines that were in game at one time as scrapped/removed content or is it just the lore progressing?

(there are games that keep past versions of the maps active however it is still happening in the past and once the story progresses... its on the newer maps + all the character interactions update there)

I get banned quite often. I understand why the game bans AFK players and those who leave matches, or those who don't choose an agent and let the others down. The thing is I NEVER did any of that on purpose. Everytime I got disconnected, it was because of a connection issue, my game crashed, or I just didn't have time to pick an agent because either the loading screen took forever or the agents in the agent selection screen just didn't show up.

So if the bans keep getting longer and longer, I might consider taking a break from playing the game so that the ban time wouldn't be as long.

Played a game tonight that had a Sage griefing throughout the entire 13 rounds.   Even at character selection, he kept saying ""dodge or lose guys, dodge or lose. I'm telling you now. Dodge this game. Or lose a rank."" And initially we didn't understand what he was trying to say (he was Platinum 1) while the rest of us were gold/silver/plat. We asked him what he meant and he just said ""Dodge this game. Or lose. you'll find out soon enough."" But we still picked (because that's what any normal player would do right?) and he said ""Alright you guys wanna lose then lets go"". 

So throughout all 13 rounds he would do the following to throw the round: 

\-wall block when we were advancing or trying to push  
\-ice the floor to prevent us from falling back when we were being rushed/give away our position  
\-wall block to corner us into a specific space when the enemy was pushing  
\-stand directly infront of us in teamfights to block our view  
\-stand in front of us when we were holding sites  
\-type in all chat and tell the enemy team all our positions and trap placements  
\-fire his gun at us to give off our positions to the enemy  


At first we were just really confused - on our team we had a Jett and an Omen who were really good and were getting good picks - but we would lose the match after he would start his wallblocks or just tell the enemy team where we were and how much HP we had left. After awhile we realised that he was determined to grief until we lost the match. 

Towards the end of the 12/13th round we were so frustrated and confused we asked him to explain to us genuinely why he was doing it, and he said that he was throwing games to get his account banned. He wanted to ban himself from playing Valorant so that he wouldn't keep trying to grind to increase his rank. **He also said he had already thrown the last 14-15 games and he still hadn't been banned yet.** 

We asked him how he felt about ruining the games for the many other players in the previous matches  - just to satisfy his want to get himself banned - and he said ""**I don't give a fuck about what other players think or feel, you're nothing to me**"". 

So his theory was that instead of just not playing Valorant (to prevent grinding) - he was going to ruin every game he was in to try and get himself banned, while spoiling the ranked game experience for hundreds of other players just trying to have fun. 

All of us reported him - but it seems like nothing is being done to stop this kind of behaviour. I've read a couple of other posts here about people griefing in games but not sure if there's been punishments meted out at all. We had a strong team and we had a good chance to win if it wasn't for the griefer.

If skin prices were priced comparable to other free-to-play games, eventually, Riot would be forced to shrink the dev team and resources being put aside for this game to compensate. Expensive skins mean that the game can stay free-to-play while maintaining a premium development team.

I hear you asking why LoL's skins are cheaper and LoL is still F2P. Simple, LoL has tenfold the player base of Valorant and countless characters all with multiple skins, has the LCS, LEC, and LCK that all have insane advertising costs for partners and buy ons for teams, and many more revenue streams.


These skins are expensive to keep the game F2P and will mean Riot won't have to franchise esports to create income for the game. If you can't afford these skins or can't justify paying that much for them, that's cool, you don't have to buy them, the others that do are making up the money needed to keep the game running.

I don't see these prices as greed, I see them as Riot wanting to keep this game AND its competitive scene as accessible as possible while maintaining the dev team. They were most likely told when pitching Valorant that they can do it with an initial budget, but have no access to LoL's revenue for additional resources. 



Whatever, call me a Riot shill if you want, it's just business at the end of the day and Riot has expenses they need to pay.

993,ObsoletePixel,1595123961,htsn7u,15,8,"Hey everyone. Before I get into writing this, I want to make it clear that I understand why skins are as expensive as they are at the top end. Riot's art and skins teams are talented and deserves to make money for their work, and the potential for the kinds of interesting skins they can make has been made abundantly clear by how imaginative the Elderflame skins are. The current price of skins on the shop \*is not a problem\*. Yes, they are expensive. Yes, that is frustrating. There's a ton of skins in this game that I want too! I totally understand and empathize with all of these concerns. Skins are a luxury item and are not necessary for gameplay though, so I understand pricing them accordingly.

&amp;#x200B;

What Riot seems to be missing is that, as well as luxury items, skins are a reward for engaging with the game via the battle pass, but they are not treated as such. Battle Pass skins \*need\* to stop being thought of as a luxury item, and need to be seen as a means to get players to engage with your game in the long-term. And, as is, the battle pass is not a reward. It's a slog. I don't need 5 or 6 vandal skins that I really like, I ultimately only need one. But the odds of a battle pass skin being my endgame when the first example of the highest tier of cosmetics we've seen is a literal moving, animated, fire-breathing dragon. Say what you will about whether or not you're a fan of the actual aesthetics, that's inspired, and the skin team did a good job. But the battle pass skins will never fill that kind of need. That's not what they're in the game for. They're neat, and supposed to provide a moderately exciting reward that, in aggregate, feels more valuable than the $10 the player put in, while also rewarding players that \*do\* care about having cool looking guns in a game they put a lot of time into.

&amp;#x200B;

As is, none of this happens. The player puts $10 and 100+ hours into a game for the ability to get maybe 2-3 skins they like, and a knife that will be obviated at some point by another knife in some other skin collection down the line, and eventually the rewards from the battle pass will no longer be as exciting, and therefore no longer be worth buying into. But by reducing the time investment down so players feel excited to unlock more items that they can switch between. The store should be aspirational for players, you should want them to be excited by guns that evoke something in them. The battle pass skins should be, in the short term, for players that want access to skins to make them feel more invested in the game, but the long-term reward of the battle pass should be choice. As is, the battle pass doesn't reward me with choice, it's a chore. I love this game and I want to play it for a while, and I want to buy the battle pass again next episode, but I've struggled to complete the battle pass for this episode \*and\* I'm in quarantine. I'm going to complete it, I'm not worried about that, but what I am worried about is my motivation to buy and complete more battle passes in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The way Riot thinks about the battle pass is out of wack, and battle pass skins need to be thought of as fundamentally different in function than shop skins. By fixing this issue and making the battle pass reward players for time spent in the game better, they incentivize people actually buying the battle pass more than once or twice to get skins for the guns they don't care about. The battle pass needs to exist to excite players about having multiple skins worth switching between long-term and maintain player engagement, but the objective of the battle pass as it stands right now is incredibly short sighted and basically serves as another avenue to turn a profit, but since it's redundant with the shop players are less interested in buying into either one because both feel over costed.",VALORANT,Let's talk about the real issue regarding skin value in Valorant: The Battle Pass

Unrated and ranked are essentially the same type of gameplay/gamemode, with ranked having a more competitive edge to it - so why are players who are unable to communicate with their team allowed to play ranked? This just hinders the team and really shouldn't be allowed in a competitive environment that's mostly based on teamplay.

Edit: this post isn't about people who CAN engage in comms but decide not to, it's about players who are BANNED and have no way of communicating other than pinging. They can’t even type.

But Spike Rush is actually amazing training for unrated/ranked and here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Too much Pistol Rounds""

We have at least 2 pistol rounds each 6\~10 minutes.

Pistol rounds, you could say, are one of the most important rounds in normal play. Winning a pistol round can make you easily win 2-3 more rounds.

Spike Rush then, let's you train for that.

""But who plays shorty/frenzy?""

True, pistol rounds people usually take either ghost or classic, but those are still strong situational weapons that have their place and training them is important. I discovered many uses for them that I use outside Spike Rush.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Orbs aren't fun""

Orbs is one of the best features. Really!

Orbs are located at points of interest and/or points to be contested. If you know how to take a orb, then you would have no problem contesting ground.

""Weapon upgrade is Unfair!""

Yes, but so are ECO rounds. And that's just one guy with a better weapon. 

Lucky for you, you have ""free"" abilities to use. Use them. How would you use your kit when you're on disadvantage? 

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Spike Rush is not a good warming/random weapons don't help""

Most people already use Vandal/Phantom whenever they can, but guess what? Most of the time you're not using a Vandal/Phantom (or just a Pistol). You're using other weapons.

You may go by what the tier lists say and buy the same guns everybody else is using, but I learned other weapons that I would use and situations to choose them.

Besides, everyone have the same weapons... what would win is the better execution/ability/strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Spike Rush is a 'clownfiesta'""

Well... if that's what you think and that's how you play there... then yes.

&amp;#x200B;

* Spike Rush is THE place to train Agents and interactions

 You have a free full kit every round. Use them, be bold with them.

1049,HardPlaysGG,1595213137,hudhj0,88,36,"I'm currently Diamond 2 and before saying that I'm low rank and I don't know what I'm talking about let me explain... I usually play with my girlfriend and my friends and they are in gold 2 to plat 1 and that makes me play with even more low ranks than me what makes me incredible hard to rank up but going to the topic, this last 2 weeks my friends and I didn't had schedule to play together so in most of the time I only played with my girlfriend. After some wins and loses I started noticing that most of the people don't know how to enter a site and because the game has so many abilities that they spend the entire round throwing random things to the air thinking they are making the difference. On the contrary people when defending a site they leave and rush because they use all of their things in the beginning and get bored of waiting or holding a angle. Now I know people are gonna judge me because me as Diamond can't carry plat / gold games but as you know this is a team game and if only 2 people don't know how to enter a site the game is 10 times harder. I just want to ask what to do in this situation? Should I try to tell them what to do? Should I just keep quiet and lose the game? I really can't find a way to deal with this type of people.

**For the people who didn't understand the title because I was too lazy to explain this is the explanation...**

When you're new to a game you don't know nothing and you'll probably do what the guy first in the scoreboard is saying without even questioning him, after a while you start to get decent enough to see yourself ranking up and being the first guy in the scoreboard, then in most fps games you reach a breaking point that you don't rank up more if you don't how to play as a team and people start studying more macro because your aim isn't all you need. After that breaking point ( In my opinion is plat / Diamond ) some people will think they already know how to play the game and they will ignore you and if you complain they will troll the game. Now hear me out, If you teach the player some basic mechanics of the game like entering a site, defend a site etc while they are on the first stage of learning the game, people would learn that basic stuff and the games would feel more competitive and it wouldn't exist such a gap in skill inside each rank. I feel that some Gold / Plat players are really good and other are terrible and the terrible ones make the good players have a hard time to rank up even if their skill level is too high for Gold or Plat.

Sorry if the text is full of gramatical errors English isn't my main language.",VALORANT,People really don't know how to attack or defend and the game doesn't have nothing to teach them that

1051,HealthyCarrot,1595240527,huivxo,35,32,"Hi all,

let me preface this with saying: I get we all play for fun and the vast majority of us are not aiming to become pro players, are not content creators or streamers.

Means: we spend time with this game in our free time to enjoy ourselves, have fun with friends and give our brain some rest from daily routines.

That being said, bypassing a system in place that exists to maintain competitive integrity, in order to maximise the fun for you and your friends is so wrong on so many levels and might generate fun in the short term, but in the long term, it will ruin the fun for everyone, including you and your friends.

Granted, one could say it's RIOTs job to make sure their systems in placed are not getting bypassed. They went above and beyond with Vanguard in order to make it as hard as possible for cheaters to ruin matches for the rest of us and this is a good thing. 

At the same time, there seems to be ZERO repercussions for smurfing which imho is an issues they need to deal with fast.

I massively enjoyed the game in the beta and after ranked mode started I massively enjoyed it again.

Ranks were a bit messy at first, but once people reached their ELOs, matches were a blast, even more so after the changes to the overtime system, which made the matches feel a lot more competitive and less coin-flippy.

The sad thing is, ever since last week, there wasn't even a single match where the overtime system even would have been needed, since so many matches were massive stomps for one team or the other and in a competitive environment, this **IS** a problem.

I personally started to see the match quality go down the drain once people had started to finish their battle passes. 

It felt like after people were done with those, there was not much incentive left to stick with their mains and smurfs started to become more common.

Here is a screenshot of my last 9 matches played: [click](https://imgur.com/6EfZjxB) ...out of those 9 matches, two were more or less close with 13-9 and 13-10, two more were less close with 13-5 and 13-6 ...five were stomps for one team or the other where the losing team could not net more than 4 rounds.

And the vast majority of those matches, it was smurfs ruining the match. Be it the 3 stack that is on a deranking mission or the lowest rank in one team single handly dominating the whole enemy team and watching him play makes it rather obvious that it is in fact not a bronze, silver or gold player, but a higher ranked player playing on a low rank account.

The problem is that smurfs not only ruin the matches they are in, they also will ruin a lot more matches after.

* they might need/ want to derank again at some point

* their boosted friends might join the solo queue again at some point and then will not be able to perform at the level they got boosted to

* which then (along with other things) will increase distrust in other players and the MM system in itself

* it will increaste toxicity and tilt overall because everyone is frustrated and ""on the edge""

* the more people have the matches ruined, the more likely they are to make smurfs themselves, maybe just to throw, maybe just to chill


Overall, actual consistency in the ladder will be less and less, you will not be able to trust your teammates, the enemy and the MM system in the first place, ranked mode will turn into a glorified quickplay mode where a lot of people don't even care anymore, but join anyways because it still is ""better"" than unrated.

My point is: it just will get worse from here and in the end a lot of people will have their matches ruined for one reason or another.

I've seen it happening in OW and I got mocked and downvoted, same like here. The last time I played OW I had matches where I often was the only one in the lobby playing on an actual main account and OW is not even a free to play game, the problem here will be tenfold worse when not addressed and contained soon.

We all are here to have fun, Valorant is a great game, let's keep it like that. Stop ruining  the game over short-term fun with your friends that might benefit you and your group now, but just will create problems for everyone, **including you and your friends**, in the long run.",VALORANT,Unpopular opinion: Smurf already are turning the ranked mode into a hot mess and this issues needs to get addressed.
1052,JunCena666,1595251144,hul3dn,13,32,"So you want to play sage? Here are some tips and tricks from me, a professional Valorant player. I have played valorant for 5 minutes, and I read one page on the wiki, so you know you're in safe hands.

1: When playing sage, NEVER HEAL TEAMMATES. While this may seem silly as sage is the only healer, you must keep yourself alive so that you can heal yourself in the future. As a result, you should never heal anyone but yourself, even if you have 97 HP and your ally has 12 HP.

2: If your teammates force you to heal them, make sure to never move towards your teammates. Politely ask them to walk across the entire map with low health and walk through enemy territory. This will make them feel more powerful and confident if they manage to reach you safely and receive healing.

3: Try to remain at spawn, and never move. This is because sage is considered a ""sentinel"" by the game. A sentinel is a soldier whose job is to stand and keep watch. The game designers have called sage a sentinel to hint at the playstyle of staying in spawn, which drastically reduces your chances of death. By defending spawn, you can make sure that the enemies don't take control of your most valuable position which is closely connected to the sites on a map.

4: When attacking as sage, try to wall off your path to the site and use slow orbs to slow your team. This will encourage your team to play more slowly and methodically, as they can no longer rush a site.

5: When defending as sage, try to wall off your teammates in corners, such that they cannot see the site or move. Your teammates with thank you for this, as they can no longer be attacked by the enemies while your wall still stands. Additionally, try to place slow orbs at the feet of your teammates so they move slowly and fire more accurately.

6: When defending a site post plant, make sure to wall yourself into a corner so that you cannot see the spike. This will allow the defenders to defuse the spike, saving you and your teammates from dying in the spike's explosion

7: When retaking a site, make sure to throw slow orbs randomly into the site to reveal your position. If you throw a slow orb at your feet, your enemies will be stunned by your genius tactics and will allow you to defuse the spike for free.

8: When using your ultimate, always resurrect teammates in enemy fire, so that they can see where the enemies are while being revived. Never wall off your resurrection target from the enemies, as you will have to push in afterwards and the wall will hinder you.


These were some of the best tips and tricks you can use as a sage main. Remember, while your teammates might get angry at you, you're doing this for their good by teaching them better practices.

So start now, and in no time you'll reach the coveted rank of iron 1.",VALORANT,Tips and tricks to improve your sage gameplay and bring it up to iron 1

The first advantage goes to the average solo players, this makes sense because it's the majority of the player base.

The next advantage goes to teams who are boosting players, the better players on the team are stuck in a rank too low because they hardly get MMR while boosting, while giving the enemy an equally low rated player who is always extremely difficult to carry. This is a horrible decision, if the rank difference is too great the party should require a full team and the weight of MMR should go in favor of the enemy, instead of trying to find a balanced match. If I have diamond  and plats on my team I shouldn't be getting a random silver because the enemy has a silver.  


The next advantage seems to go for parties of 2, it's usually all solo players and other teams of 2.

There are no more advantages after that.

Parties of 5 tend to go up against smaller teams of much higher ranked players, on average a full division higher per player.

Teams of 4 you almost always get the boosted player from the second listed advantage team who thought it would be a good idea to play solo.

And I don't know what is about teams of 3 but the matches are always super easy or super hard. I just want balance.

IMO parties of 2 &amp; 3(when their ranks are similar) as well as solos should all have the same MMR weight distribution. MMR should also stop trying to put the highest MMR player with the lowest MMR players,  this doesn't create balance it keeps bad players &amp; good players in ranks they don't belong in.",VALORANT,Ranked game play is in a weird spot right now.

The \~1s recoil reset is just a braindead concept to me as a CSGO veteran now with a ton of valorant games behind me. Holding a site as 2 people is straight up impossible/RNG if they are 5 man rushing as transitioning from one target to another (if you shot multiple rounds) will just mean you have to wait a time during which they definetly kill you or have an aim like you are running.

Whenever these technical arguments came up about the CSGO-Valorant mechanincs the arguments are that: Valorant doesn't have to be like CSGO, it's more accesable, team focused, less focused on god-like aim.

Now what the high accuracy reset time creates doesn't even seem to stand up to these standards:

\-It is highly frustrating to see that you haven't shot for a time and your crosshair reseted position and everything, but your shots still go nowhere where you aim which is definetly a terrible new player experience, but even as a vetran FPS player

\-More frustration that you barely can kill more than 1-2 targets rushing making crossfires to be   
less effective and promoting brainless rushing

\-God-like aim actually becomes more prevelant, with tournaments being played now high level Valorant gameplay seems to revolve all around 1-tapping people as that barely effects your accuracy",VALORANT,Accuracy reset time needs to be decreased

While the ranked system clearly has flaws it's not the main issue here.


Speaking as someone who is currently D3 in Val, has 2-3k hours of CS:GO (SMFC peak), 4k+ hours of LoL (D3 peak), and many hours of other competitive games let me tell you a few important things so that you can avoid the pitfalls I've made.


1. **Most important** - *This is not an RPG.* Grinding in this game (unless you are already way above the skill level of your rank) is absolutely pointless and just because you play a lot does not mean you should be consistently progressing and ranking up. I've played League since season 1 constantly trying to ""grind"" to gold, then plat then diamond. I yelled at my teammates, I blamed matchmaking when in reality I just wasn't that good. This poor mindset made it so that I was stuck at the same rank for YEARS with multiple chat bans.

2. Dropping 20+ kills a game in gold and getting Match MVP means absolutely nothing. If you are winning or losing games where you get Match/Team MVP with 20 kills and the game goes 13-7 that means you're averaging 1 kill per round. This doesn't even take into consideration having low impact kills in rounds you lose like getting two exit kills on a lost round which will inflate your kda. 

3. This should seem pretty obvious but winning against people who have lower ranks than you in close games (13-11), is going to give you almost no gains. It just shows that you are at the appropriate level, and that's okay! To give you another perspective I ""grinded"" to diamond in Riot's Team Fight Tactics. Only the top 4 of 8 players in a game are guaranteed elo gains. But the difference between 1st and 4th is astronomical. 1st may get you anywhere between 30-50lp (out of 100) where 4th may sometimes get you 8lp. Winning is important but it's a lot about how you win.


If you play to actively get better and be a tier above what your rank is now, instead of trying to grind your way up, you will eventually get a higher rank. But getting better is more than just playing Valorant. You need to review your games and how YOU played (not your teammates). You should compare how you play to professional players to see what you're doing wrong. You can work on getting your aim more consistent through aim trainers if you find you are constantly over or undershooting your targets.


This leads into another important topic:

* Posting clips on this subreddit of your best performing round and asking what you can do to improve does absolutely nothing for you and this subreddit. It's just another way to pass the blame and it is extremely transparent.

You are not as good as you think you are... but you can be! You can be better, you can improve! But that should be the goal. Not to play more so that the rank you think you deserve shows up on your screen.

I don't think my post will stop all the complaining on the valorant subs but I do think it might help some people realize that the game isn't against them and sometimes we need to own up to how things are. I do hope this helps some people",VALORANT,PSA to those frustrated with the climb

This means when there are less players alive on your team than on the enemy team. This is very apparent when it comes to clutch situations on the attacker side.

For example, if you're in a 1vX situation with the bomb planted (X being 2 or more people), you need to equalize the situation by creating 1v1 duels that you can take. Unless you're playing a character with some sort of special utility that can delay defuses safely (i.e. Brimstone), you're not going to be able to realistically play the bomb even in a 1v2. This is because one guy can just stick the bomb and the second guy can either hunt for you or hold a weird off angle where you can be, so if you peek out and try to jiggle/kill the defuser, you'll die to the off angle guy. This is even more true when you're in a 1vX against utility heavy opponents that can molotov you out or wall/smoke off several areas where you could be at, forcing you into an even more unfavorable situation. 

Many many times I'll see a guy just hide behind a box and do absolutely nothing while he either gets swung on two sides, or he'll end up trying to peek the bomb defuser too late and just die to another guy holding an angle. 

There are times when playing passive in this scenario could work, such as if you know the rotation is extremely slow and the bomb timer is already almost gone, you probably could play passively. 

In non-clutch situations where there's a man disadvantage, you have to also find opportunities to equalize the situation so you can get back into the round. For example, if you're defender side and your team in the round is 3v5, you're probably not going to win the round if you just hold passively. If you're ""offered"" a free 1v1 fight that you think is reasonably winnable, you should probably take that fight to equalize the numbers somewhat so that your team has a better shot at winning the round. This is also why you see some players walk push out of their site on defender when there isn't info being given, or if someone on their team died but an execute isn't happening on the site that the teammate got picked off on. 

This is an extremely well-understood concept in games like CS:GO, and I feel like it applies enough here that you guys would be able to take away from and directly apply to Valorant.

I haven't been playing Valorant lately, but I was Diamond before taking a break, and I've noticed something in a lot of the low rank clips on here. When people are smoking out lines of sight as Brimstone or Omen, they're not really worrying about where exactly their smoke lands, as long as it covers the doorway/whatever it is. This isn't how you should smoke. If possible, line your smoke up so that ~85-90% of the smoke is inside the enemy's side of the doorway. Don't just smack it right in the middle of the doorway. The reason for this is that if you give the enemy too much room to maneuver on your side of the smoke, it's easier for them to push through without being exposed to multiple lines of sight. If your side of the smoke is roughly flush with the entryway, however, the instant they try to come through the smoke they're going to be exposed to multiple lines of sight, and have no cover to play around. 

TL;DR Make the side of your smoke which is visible to your team flush with the entry point you're smoking, so the enemy has no cover to play with if they're pushing through the smoke.",VALORANT,Another Helpful Tip For Smoking Angles

* The Vandal: A modern AK variant (duh). One key difference between IRL AK's and the Vandal is the Vandal's  charging handle (what you pull to ""cock"" the gun) is found on the left side instead of the right. The AK is sort of known for having its charging handle on the right, so just a thought.
* The Phantom: The Phantom is a carbon-copy suppressed SCAR-L variant
*  The Guardian: Definitely is a futurized M1 Garand. However, three key differences exist. The magazine is reloaded from the bottom, like modern firearms, instead of the Garand's signature 8 round stripper clip. The magazine is larger, carrying 12 rounds instead of 8. There is also a modern pistol-style grip on the Guardian, a trait found in nearly all modern firearms. 
* The Classic: It seems is a slightly futurized FN-9 handgun, judging from its distinctive grip. 
* The Shorty: Just your typical hill-billy sawed-off double-barreled shotgun.
* The Judge: Everyone's love/hate relationship is a futurized AA-12 full-auto shotgun, with a drum mag that for some reason, only hold 7 shells.  The drum mag in real life can hold up to 32 shells! So either the Judge is using a 7 round drum mag (which is stupid, as drum mags have a tendency to have feeding issues, just use a normal mag!), or firing really really large shells. 
* The Sheriff: Just your typical six-shooter revolver chambered in a high caliber. Maybe .308
* The Marshall: This is just your typical cowboy Western lever action rifle with a scope mounted on it.  Maybe a Remington model. 
* The Bulldog: Definitely is an AUG variant. (fun fact, it's named the Bulldog because it's a bullpup assault rifle, which means the magazine and firing system is located behind the grip. Bullpup? Bulldog? Get it?)
* The Bucky: This shotgun is a most likely a shorter version of the M870 Remington pump-action shotgun

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Not-So Obvious**

Here is where we can see Riot start to either mix guns together or simply insert their own unique guns:

* The Ghost: The Ghost may seem like a USP-S to CS:GO players, but its actually not not. It's much sleeker, with a lower profile than the USP pistol. If I had to guess, it's a futurized Walther P38, with a super thick trigger guard as a touch from Riot's design team. 
* The Frenzy: This pistol looks nothing like the CZ-75, despite CS:GO players calling the Frenzy Riot's knockoff CZ. This pistol accepts it's magazine in front of the grip, a feature found in the Tec-9. However, the Frenzy obviously does not look like a Tec-9, so its probably a fusion of whatever normal pistol and the Tec, with Riot's own unique touches added. 
* The Stinger: This SMG is most likely a fusion of the UMP SMG and the CZ Scorpion Evo 3. The stock, grip, bolt, reciever and magazines match the UMP, while the barrel shroud matches the CZ Scorpion. The Stinger also inherits the Scorpions extremely fast rate of fire, clocking in at 1080 rounds per minute. Not as fast as the Scorpion IRL but that's damn fast. 

**On a side note, Riot, WHY ARE YOUR RATE OF FIRE STATS LISTED IN ROUNDS PER SECOND? USE ROUNDS PER MINUTE LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE GODDAMIT!**

Ok, back to business. 

* The Spectre: The gun seems to be a fusion of the famous MP5 and the M16 family of rifles. The barrel, grip, and signature curved 30 round magazine all match the MP5's charcteristics. It even has the MP5's famous telescoping stock, which your character pulls out when he/she equips the weapon. However, the Spectre does not have the MP5 firing system, instead possessing the M16 family's firing system where the charging handle is found in the form of a bolt found behind the rear sights of the gun. 
* The Operator: The Op seems to be a fusion of two .50 caliber sniper rifles: The Macmillan Tac-50 and the Barrett M82 sniper. The Operator possess the Tac-50's bolt action system with a bit of futuristic details, while also possessing the Barrett's magazine capacity (5 rounds), receiver, and barrel. The Operator, judging from its disticntive boom, and the size of the bullets, fires a similar .50 BMG cartridge. What does that mean? Your character's shoulders should be fucking broken after firing this gun multiple times, let alone even once. .50 cal sniper are designed to be fired from a mounted/prone position because .50 cal rounds are super powerful.  
* The Ares: I can't think of any guns that the Ares is modeled off of at the moment, so I'll just say that Riot designed their own gun. Seems like your typical SAW (squad automatic weapon) that you would give to the support guy in your squad. It even comes with a bipod.
* The Odin: The Odin is probably of Riot's own design, I can't think of any other HMG's that look similar to this in any way at the moment. However, judging from the size of the cartridges in the belt, it fires .50 caliber rounds. Which makes no goddamn sense, given the Odin's fire rate. .50 caliber machine guns and automatic weapons of higher calibers are mounted for a reason. The most famous .50 cal machine gun, the M2 Browning, has a pretty slow rate of fire at 400-500 RPM unless mounted on aircraft, and that's for good reason. There's no feasible way to shoot bullets of that power grade accurately at high fire rates on the ground, even when mounted. The Odin has near double that fire rate, at 936 RPM at max ramp. Only 2-3 Operator shots can hurt you severely when firing from your shoulder. Now imagine what will happen if you just fire hundreds of Operator shots at 936 rounds per minute.  Ah well. Video game it is.
* Knife: The Knife seems to be just a knife of Riot's own design. A blade with a molded grip, a serrated back edge, and blade shape that reminds me of the US KA-BAR.  Knife's a knife!",VALORANT,What are Valorant Guns like IRL?

1134,Hi_Im_TwiX,1595350233,hvaypy,47,98,"#  The Training Issue in Valorant

Hey guys, back again with another lengthy post that the majority of you probably won't be bothered to read through! Let me begin by saying that I believe Valorant has tons of potential as a competitive tac shooter, and I have been enjoying the game greatly, which is why I believe it would be wrong to overlook some of the glaring issues that could easily be improved upon. We all know that there are server-side issues in this game in the form of peeker's advantage, hit registration, etc. but I'm certain that the dev team is very aware of these problems and is actively working on fixing them, so I won't focus on them in this post. The issue I am concerned about and interested in raising awareness about in this post, is the lack of in-game training provisions. As a coach, it is quite disappointing that every time I'm creating a training routine for someone, I have to find maps on Kovaak's that compensate for the lack of an in-game deathmatch, or a decently structured firing range, or a proper bomb site retake emulator ( no spike defuse in the range doesn't count ). The lack of such fundamental ways to train in-game is a huge detriment to the individual improvement of players, especially in the aspect of mechanics. While training your aim through aim trainers is also necessary to address more specific weaknesses which are related to raw aim, there are certain mechanics ( crosshair placement, spraying patterns, movement, etc. ) which it is better to work on through in-game provisions. The top aimers in CSGO came long before FPS aim trainers were mainstream, and the way they achieved their top tier skill level in aiming was through playing hours and hours of Free for all deathmatch.

# The Solution

In CSGO, the base game's resources in terms of maps that allow you to train fundamental mechanics are pretty lackluster as well, instead, the workshop allows players to create their own maps / gamemodes etc. which leads to a diversified pool of resources which allows players to browse through hundreds of thousands of player created content in order to find what they're looking for; Since the Valorant dev team doesn't seem too inclined to adding a workshop or custom game browser to Valorant ( keep in mind how long it took for Overwatch to introduce such a feature ), for which they probably have valid reasons, here are a couple of improvements / additions that could be made to the current game structure that I believe would be highly beneficial to the playerbase.

***Firing Range:***

* Add the ability for players to customize the range further, allow players to set the amount of target dummies that spawn on the map, ( Too many dummies = not enough range between each dummy to allow proper target-switching practice ) Allow players to set the model movement speed and strafe interval ( how often dummies switch direction ) for moving dummies, allow players to spawn peek walls to practice strafe peeking and wallbanging, and finally allow the dummies to spawn in a wider area.

***Spike Defuse:***

* Spike defuse is a great recreation of CSGO retake servers, but with AI replacing actual players. If done properly, this gamemode found within the practice range, could be one of the most beneficial forms of in-game training. Spike defuse allows you to actively train your ability to clear angles, position your crosshair properly, and peek into bomb sites. This gamemode ( in theory ) could be the best form of specifically training your ability to retake sites post-plant. In CSGO, there are maps called ""Prefire &gt;insert map name&lt;"" found on the workshop that do this perfectly, you choose a map, select the bomb site you want to practice retaking, and then select the difficulty of the bots, the amount of bots, and your weapon / armor tier of choice. The bots spawn in realistic positions, that real players would hold in a live game scenario, and the spawn positions are randomized each time you die or the run is reset ( manually or through killing all targets ). If the Spike defuse mode in Valorant could evolve into a mode which allows us to choose the map, bomb site, and amount of bots / difficulty of bots that spawn, this could be huge in helping players improve. The gamemode is currently far too repetitive, lacks variety and customization, and isn't even part of an actual map in the game.

***Deathmatch:***

* Finally, a very obvious addition much desired by the Valorant community is the implementation of a deathmatch gamemode. The gamemode doesn't need to be too in-depth, simply allow random spawns with an algorithm that stops people from spawning too near to others, a set score limit, and a server member cap of 10 - 15 players. Abilities should be disabled in this game mode, as it's meant to be a form of training your gunplay and movement, not your utility usage. Deathmatch should be ""Free for all"" as it allows much more fluid and continuous combat, and is better suited for variable spawn rates. A Deathmatch feature would be a great way to train in-game gunplay fundamentals such as crosshair placement, peeking / holding angles, and combat related movement, in a much more fluid nature than simply playing unrated matches over and over again. The biggest issue with playing unrated to improve your mechanics is that there are massive amounts of down-time where you're not really doing much, an FFA deathmatch allows you to constantly be in combat, so 20 minutes of FFA = 20 minutes of active combat, whereas a 1 hour long unrated game realistically results in something closer to 15 minutes of added combat, so you're wasting 4 times the time, for the same return ( which is probably not even true, since in actual matches you have much more to focus on in combat than just movement / aim ).

1138,lyssbagel,1595351300,hvbb2t,32,85,"So yesterday, I hopped on Valorant with my (very skilled FPS player) boyfriend to play a few unrated games. I'm obsessed with Valorant. I've never played an FPS before but I'm having a blast even though my performance is pretty inconsistent currently. Some games I'm top frag or in the middle of my team and others I barely get a kill (I think it has more to do with me psyching myself out more than anything AND still learning how to move well.) Yesterday, one of the games we played, I had 0 kills by like 13 rounds. It was making me doubt myself so hard which just made my performance worse and worse. Suddenly, a teammate said ""hey guys let's help Reyna get a kill"" and so they did. They moved forward and told me to stay towards the back and really tried hard to help me get one. Still didn't happen. A couple rounds later, I got my first kill of the game and not only did my entire team cheer me on but the opposing team did as well. I ended up getting 2 more kills that game and they did nothing but support me and hype me up. It made me enjoy the game that much more and then I went on to play a couple games that night where I was top fragging. Sometimes the Valorant community can really get me down but man, that was awesome and I hope someone from that game reads this, recognizes my username, and continues to do that in future games where a teammate is severely under performing. You have no idea how happy/supported that made me feel.",VALORANT,A Not So Toxic Game Yesterday

Interesting findings:

* Gold 1-2 is the median rank
* Less than 1% of players can claim the coveted Iron 1 rank as their own
* Not too surprising, but less than 0.01% of players are Radiant
* The Diamond to Immortal cutoff separates the top 1% of players

**Disclaimer, Assumptions, and Biases:** 

* This graph was based on data provided by [Blitz.gg](https://Blitz.gg) as of 7/19/2020. There is a tab on [Blitz.gg](https://Blitz.gg) that shows number of games played, per map, per rank. I took the aggregate number of games played and used that to estimate the actual distribution of rank across all players, assuming there's a strong enough correlation between the two to provide meaningful results.
* This data only ""samples"" players who have [Blitz.gg](https://Blitz.gg) installed. If we assume players with [Blitz.gg](https://Blitz.gg) are higher skilled than the average (may or may not be true), then this chart is biased towards higher ranks and misrepresents the number of players in lower ranks.
* **TL;DR: Process this data with a grain of salt.**

1144,Khalixs1,1595360299,hve71z,22,52,"Ok, this might be dumb, but I think I'm on to something. I think Valorant is in need of a game mode that is more than just a CS:GO rip and Spike Rush ain't it. People have suggested generic things like a deathmatch and other practice modes, but honestly why settle for something so unimaginative? Fortnite's Battle Royale wasn't their main game mode, but ended up being more popular than their main game. So I was thinking, what would be a great game mode idea? and then it hit me: bed wars.  No no don't click off, hear me out. The classic Minecraft PvP game mode was popular for a reason. It featured 4 teams fighting to control points and protect their bases something that no shooter has attempted since. But how, you ask would this work for Valorant? It would need a new map. However, it would fit the Valorant aesthetic. The fractured floating islands fit with the theme of Ascent and would be wonderful for a Bed Wars style game mode. The game mode could be called Spike Wars and here's how it would go down. 

&amp;#x200B;

1st all players spawn on their island corner of the map 4 teams of 5. 

&amp;#x200B;

All players spawn in with a classic and collect credits from the forge at their base and at control points in the surrounding area in order to purchase gun upgrades, ammo, armor and buffs. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are control points in the center of the map as well as other contested points that players can attempt to hold in exchange for various rewards. 

&amp;#x200B;

With enough credits a team can forge a ""spike"" this can be planted in the opposing team's base and when planted the opposing team no longer respawns. If the spike can be defused players will once again respawn. However, if the team dies with a spike planted they will be eliminated. A Spike can also be planted at the center of the map and if defended successfully it will explode winning the game for the team that planted it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the game goes on, respawns are made longer and longer until a sudden death is activated at the end of the round where all teams lose their ability to respawn.",VALORANT,"Wait, hear me out. I think I have a crazy game mode idea."

1163,JunCena666,1595335821,hv6s55,4,25,"Some of you may have read my guide on how to play sage. Since no one requested it, I shall make a guide on Phoenix.

As some of you may already know, I have played phoenix for 5 minutes in the range, so I think it's safe to say I'm pretty experienced.

Here are some of the top tips and tricks you can use to become the next pablo.gonzales2007

1: When playing phoenix, always use your curveball to flash your teammates. Their screens will become bright for a second or two. Use this to help sleepy players stay awake. Your teammates are sure to thank you for your service.

2: You can use your hot hands and blaze wall to heal yourself, so make sure to use these on your teammates as well. Your teammates won't be able to heal, but they will appreciate the gesture and team morale will increase drastically.

3: If you need to use your hot hands ability to heal yourself, make sure to throw the fire into a corner where your teammates with low health are standing, and run into the corner so that your teammate is trapped and cannot escape. The enemies will think that there is no one hidden in the corner because of the damage usually inflicted by the ability, and they will proceed to walk past the corner without checking it. If the enemies happen to push within 5 seconds before your teammate succumbs to the flames, your ally will be able to secure a kill, and your team will win the round. This is a popular deception tactic used in high level wood 3 matches.

4: Try using your blaze wall to wall off your line of sight from the bomb site, so that you are protected from enemy fire. Ideally, you would hide 4 allies and yourself behind this wall in a corner, so that your teammates are safe from fire.

5: If you are ever in direct fire, make sure to use your ultimate ability, Run it Back, to quickly escape. Your enemies will chase after you, and once your ultimate ends, you will return to the place where you started. Your enemies will be baffled by your superior intellect and strategy, and they will instantly call a vote to surrender.

6: Phoenix's powers are based around fire, so make sure to flame your teammates when they don't win a 1v5 fight because you ran into enemy fire and died. This will improve team morale, and will help strengthen the tight bond between you and your teammates.

7: When attacking as Phoenix, force your supportive agents to enter the site first so they are ready to support you when you enter the site, enabling you to get an ace. If your support agents die when entering the site, make sure to flame them to emphasise the fact that all your powers are based around flames.

8: When defending a site as Phoenix, try to equip your curveball and unequip it repeatedly to make lots of noise. This will give away your position, and when the enemies come to kill you, you can shoot them and win the round.

9: When retaking a site as Phoenix, try to throw your hot hands ability onto the spike so that your teammates cannot defuse the spike. They will have to wait for you to defuse it, and will acknowledge your superiority

10: When defending a site post plant, make sure to run away from the spike immediately after planting it. This enables you to find enemies and kill them, while also keeping you safe if the spike explodes.

11: Some players may tell you to practice flicking to targets' heads to improve your aim. A good way to practice this is by joining a competitive match and flicking your cursor to the lock in button after selecting Phoenix. This will improve your chances of playing Phoenix, and will make your team happy as they do not have to wait for another person to select their agent, usually saving them 5-10 seconds. Don't forget to spam ""sage pls"" in chat to boost team morale!

For those who aren't aware, I'll some it up real quick. When you buy a skin set, you are only paying for the model and the opportunity to upgrade the effects. 

To put this in other terms, let's compare this to Riot's other game ""League of Legends"". This is like if in League, when you buy a skin.

1202,DonAsiago,1595416350,hvrwln,1500,4016,"Hello guys,

since the current popular topic is that the recoil time is longer than it should be and it takes away certain skill by basically forcing you to pray and spray, I've noticed that there is other thing that takes skill and replaces it with RNG.

It is the first shot inaccuracy, which means that even though you have your crosshair centered on your opponents head, there is a chance that the shot will miss.

I went to the practice range, sent the bot to 50 m, bought operator, centered the crosshair on his ""eye"" and then bought vandal. I had shooting bound to keyboard to prevent any unnecessary mouse movement and the result is that:

Out of the 20 shots that I took with crosshair perfectly centered over the bots head, only 9 of them counted as headshot. That's 45% accuracy.

https://gfycat.com/deadbetterjaguar

Keep in mind that this is with crosshair perfectly centered, so to chance to miss goes up if your aim is sllightly off. I can imagine that if you aim at the left third of the head hitbox, you will get even worse numbers.

This means that Riot decided that they want to equalize the playing field by replacing a portion of your skill with RNG. No matter how good your aim is, you might still not get the kill and on the other hand thanks to that the guy on the other side, despite not aiming at your head might actually headshot you.

Why does it bother me so much? Because the way Valorant presents itself is ""competitive shooter"" with ""competitive integrity"" as its focus. RNG has no place in any of these and it is my opinion that individual skill should be the deciding factor, not RNG.

It seems Valorant instead tries to blur the lines a bit to make the game more newbie friendly in order to maximize player base. And with the number of skins that are being pushed out, it feels like Valorant tries to be the next Fortnite rather than the next CSGO.",VALORANT,Decided to test out first shot innacuracy of Vandal at 50 meters. 20 shots = 9 hits.

I assume the last set of weekly missions will give around the same amount of xp, maybe 1k more each. It doesn't really make a difference.

This is the first time I play a game I like with a battlepass system. I thought playing a couple games every day would be more than enough to complete the thing. Oh boy I was wrong.

If you don't play 2 to 3 games a day, **every single day** of the battlepass' length, you won't make it to level 50. Period.

Had a long day at work and you want to rest a bit instead of playing? Nope.

Want to spend a week-end with your family and friends? Nope.

This is very anti-consumer practice and I don't think it should be the norm. I consider myself lucky because the day the battlepass launched, I noticed there was absolutely no benefit of buying it early on so I didn't buy it yet. But a lot of people did and most of them will fall short of level 50 and will have to make a choice. A tough choice. Give up on the last rewards or spend a little extra VP on the battlepass.

This has been thoroughly calculated and designed by Riot Games for it to end like this. **They are not your friends**, they are trying to squeeze every bit of money they can by playing with your brain. Don't fall for it.

My hope is that for the next battlepass, either Riot Games realize their battlepass model is grindy, and do something about it (which I never expect from them) or that way more people speak with their wallet and don't buy the next battlepass. That will teach them.

Feel free to follow my [twitter](https://twitter.com/ValorantExpress) for sooner and more frequent updates, now let's get into it!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start off with some Act info this time.

The Act is currently set to end on August 4th. After that the second Act is set to run from August 4th to October 13th, with the Third act running from October 13th to January 12th, 2021. These dates are subject to change.

Next, some huge agent news!

\- Voice-lines were added to characters such as Reyna, Cypher, and Breach for the upcoming and unreleased agent, ""Killjoy"". A description of what the voice-lines are for is included in the video below.

[New Voice-lines were added, teasing the upcoming agent, Killjoy.](https://reddit.com/link/hw3pjc/video/ojtdkwt36hc51/player)

Next up, we have some new Killjoy Audio files, that were added for his sound effects. The sound effects added were shooting sounds for his cannon, as well as a ""power up"" and ""power down"" sound that could be for any of his abilities.

Finally, we have some new sounds added for the ""Agent Selection Screen"". Using this newly added audio, we can deduce that Killjoy's selection animation will be him equipping his turret, and it firing. Cool stuff!

NOTE: This audio is raw from game files, not mixed like usual, so it will be loud.

Miscellaneous:

* A lot of props with leaves have been added with wind functionality. This was added by Riot in 1.04 to create a more immersive experience. A couple of people have asked me if there is a way to disable this (because people ""need"" 400fps), and I'm sure it's somehow tied into an effect. If your playing on low settings already, you probably won't see this in-game. A new prop with wind is shown below, this one is for the map Haven.

* This interesting prop was added, where it's located on a map I have no idea.

EDIT: This prop is used in the updated Shoe Store found on Split.

* A couple typo's were fixed among string tables in 1.04.
* Butterfly's were added under Environmental VFX.
* Vent Smoke was updated for the map Haven.

I spend a couple of hours doing this every update, so I would appreciate a follow on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ValorantExpress). Thanks for reading everyone, and stay safe.

1216,Emseriss,1595435823,hvx1qa,181,384,"When i first used Sovas drone after this patch, it feels like it weights a metric fuckton and it feels really fucking bad trying to clear corners with it cause it takes way too long to turn it now.

Idk if it's a bug or what but the drone feels really bad to use now.

Try it out in a custom game and tell me if you feel the same way.

Edit:

I think the drone is much slower now, because you aren't able to aim outside of the darts shooting range circle (the big circle when using the drone) anymore.

1219,Cynadote,1595433899,hvwghr,164,306,"Walking inaccuracy is too low in this game that it doesnt punish players for being caught offguard while moving and not able to properly stop to shoot. I feel like this seriously lowers the games skill ceiling as people don't have to master movement as much as in other games (like CS) and while Valorant is not CS, CS' movement inaccuracy is amazing. If you move even a slight while shooting, your shots won't connect and that is fine. It makes the game less luck based and more skill based where you actually have to learn to stop and shoot in a unison increasing the game's ceiling of skill.  


Now to the other thing, first shot inaccuracy. I will never get why guns don't have first shot accuracy in CS and now its a thing in Valorant which absolutely blows. You should award highly precise players rather than making their first shot randomized causing them to miss. Valorant shouldn't be like a dice where you have 1/3 chance of missing a clear headshot and 2/3 chances of hitting it. If my crosshair is on the clearly on the head, it should *clearly* be a headshot. There is no reason to even punish such a shot if the player is accurate.

1224,Quiknine,1595405961,hvpxwh,112,152,"I’m maybe used to csgo, but in cs you can see when a smoke is about to disappear and it fades out in 2 or 3 seconds.

On Valorant, smokes instant fades out, and it can be very frustrated.    
Few examples:    
- you think you can cross and the smoke disappears ah the worst moment
- you’re about to retake, behind a smoke, abilities in hand and the smoke disappears 

And sometimes it can be anticipated but it not always the case, if I came from the other bombsite or if they are a lot of smokes with a different timer for each of them.

I don’t know if a slow fade out is the solution but an indicator that shows that the smoke is about to disappear seems necessary to me

EDIT:    
I thought it would be unanimous but we are very divided on this.
You convince me than a slow fade out is not good because who sees who first can be random and frustrating.    

But I'm still convinced an indicator should be show. 

A lot of you mention that learning when the smoke faded out should be known and are part of the skill. In my opinion, i disagree, you are not always present when the smokes pops up, make it hard to anticipate.  
And currently you can't exactly predict when the smoke is about to fade out.  

For me, that make some duels randoms, unless you're aim at the smoke knowing the exact second it fades out (without take into account that you can have like a Jett's smoke, omen'smoke and brimstone'smoke at the same time). That's why for me it looks important to have that. I'm not talking about a big timer on the smoke obviously, just an indicator that show the smoke is about to fade out in the next second.

1231,JunCena666,1595404760,hvppi7,15,95,"After making my [guide for phoenix](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hv6s55/tips_and_tricks_to_help_bring_your_phoenix/) and my [guide for sage](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hul3dn/tips_and_tricks_to_improve_your_sage_gameplay_and/), I have decided to make a guide for omen. This is a highly detailed guide oriented towards players already at plastic 3, so if you aren't at that rank yet, you may have trouble following this guide. 

I haven't unlocked omen yet, so it's safe to say I am a professional Omen main.

These tips and tricks are highly effective, and will help you reach your desired rank of plastic 1 within a few days.

1: Omen is a ""controller"" in Valorant. While inexperienced players might think this means that he has to take map control, they are wrong. ""Controller"" refers to the fact that you can increase your skills greatly by playing omen on an Xbox controller. Using a keyboard and mouse will hinder you from achieving your true potential.

2: You can use your paranoia ability to blind enemies and push into a site. A clever way to use this ability is to stand behind your team while entering a site and blinding your entire team. When your teammates cannot see, they will be forced to improvise a strategy which will be far better than your current strategy. Your teammates will thank you for your assistance.

3: Your shrouded step ability allows you to teleport short distances. Inexperienced players will use this to cross enemies watching areas and chokepoints with operators. However, this is not a viable strategy  as your enemies will know that you are playing omen and will assume that you have already crossed their sightlines. However, this is incorrect usage of the ability. When you see an enemy, use your shrouded step to teleport behind them. They will be stunned, and you can kill them with your knife to save ammo. This little known strategy is used in professional wood 3 games.

4: Your dark cover is an invaluable ability which lets you place rechargeable smokes. One way to use this is to purchase a shorty or bucky, and place a smoke at spawn. Hide inside the smoke, ideally with your entire team, and when enemies come to your spawn you can run outside the smoke and kill them. Don't forget to keep running in circles inside the smoke to give away your position!

5: Your ultimate ability ""From the Shadows"" allows you to teleport to any location on the map. Use this to teleport a few feet ahead of your teammates so that you can reach the site first and win the marathon. Remember, Valorant is not a game about teamwork and coordination to plant the spike, it is a marathon where you must run into the site as fast as possible to win the race.

6: When attacking a site, make sure to smoke off your entrance to the site. Your enemies will not expect you to come from that entrance, and you can surprise them by walking through the smoke and killing them. After taking control, don't forget to use your shrouded step to run away before you even plant the spike.

7: When defending a site, always push into the enemies and blind any allies helping you defend the site. Ideally you should abandon the site and take control of the attacker spawn, so that the enemies cannot retreat to their spawn safely.

8: When retaking a site, fire your paranoia into the sky to give away your position and blind any enemies who happen to be 500m above you. Try to smoke off the exact same spot with multiple smokes to waste utility and confuse your enemies with your stupidity.

9: When defending a site post plant, use your smokes to smoke off another bomb site where there are no enemies, and make sure to stand on the spike. When enemies start firing at you, make sure to use your shrouded step to run away from the spike, and allow the defenders to defuse the spike so that nobody dies, because human life is precious.

These were some tips for omen. Try to use them in battle and you shall ~~derank~~ rank up extremely fast.",VALORANT,Tips and tricks to take your omen to plastic 1
1232,dwiezal,1595437654,hvxmqy,74,91,"I had a teammate that spent the entire game spamming “Nice!” Using the in-game voice commands, and there was no way to mute him.

I reported him, since he was also actively throwing, but that didn’t make me feel better. I was so irritated by the unkillable repetitive voice ringing in my ears the entire game that it felt like a loss, even though we managed to win and I was able to pull through as match MVP.

Is there a way to mute this? I couldn’t find it. If there is no way, this is a NEEDED fix.

When I went to queue this time the game gave me a 2 min freeze for not picking a character! I wait it out and join a new game. Same thing happens to the letter. Join a THIRD game and I make it past character select and think everything is alright...ONLY FOR THE GAME TO CRASH ON SPAWN. I try to rejoin, and I’m able to, only to crash after another 15-30 seconds. I’m sure I’ve been reported by everyone in that match because none of them had mics so I doubt they heard me pleas for help between crashes.

As someone who has seen both the high and low tier play, here are my suggestions for what changes should be made. I soloq'd about 95% of my games, so I have seen all different types of teammates.  This game's mechanics imo are amazing, and I really enjoy playing but these are the changes I would make...

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Raze currently has the highest combat score on [blitz.gg](https://blitz.gg)'s stats page.  Raze just got hit with an extra ult point nerf but I think a small but impactful nerf would be to make her satchels safe.  This means satchels do no damage output to teammates or enemies and just acts as a jumppad.  As someone who mains Raze myself I know how valuable the satchels can be without damage but the fact that you can take defusers off bombs and get kills on pistols with it seems op.  
2. The operator may be balanced more in the pro scene but for normal, competitive players it is nearly unstoppable when you are defending with a good economy.  This makes maps like Bind and Split really difficult for soloq players to counteract the Op on.  My suggestion would be to increase the price to 5000 as a temporary measure, but also to make it less mobile in the future.
3. B site on Bind is neither fun to attack nor defend.  The map is heavily defender sided in general, and the attackers don't have many options for taking site.  This is especially prevalent at the lower ranks, as b site hits are normally clunky and don't allow for free-flowing gameplay.  I would love to see a connection between hookah and long, and a staircase on the side of hookah where the box is, allowing for players to walk down instead of having to jump out.
4. Jett's dash with shotgun/op at times feels like it shouldn't be a part of the game to manipulate movement to the extent that she can, but she is balanced because of her weak utility.  However, I would still nerf her dash to go only 3/4 of the distance you can now, in order to allow the enemy team to have a chance at trading, unless used in smart, safe positions.",VALORANT,Thoughts on Nerfs/Buffs from an Immortal player.

1300,541hans,1595497992,hwcxvo,1778,9156,"Just some guy's dumb opinion but, I would personally love to see more maps than agents in this game. I'd much prefer have one new map per episode or act or whatever than an agent. Because I feel like with the current 11 we have right now, they all already have unique abilities and playstyles to keep people busy without craving for a new one, whereas the maps however, at least for me, I'm getting so fricking tired of playing in Haven for the fifth time in a row. Plus, me personally I am REALLY interested in the lore of this game would love to see more of the world. It's not a complaint, more of a suggestion. Thanks 4 readin

P.S. I understand that creating maps is much more time consuming and challenging on the devs part, so to compensate, another solution would just be to let the community create maps and just pick the best one using like a contest or something and the winner gets to have a free dragon skin or something. Just a suggestion.

1308,najken,1595468671,hw6vyq,273,698,"I know that picking or banning of maps is not coming anytime soon since there are only 4 maps at the moment. And i know that a lot of players strongly prefer some maps and hate others (i'm talking about you split)

And this, what seems to be pure random system creates big problem, playing same map over and over multiple times.

For example i played split 13 times  out of last 20 competitive games, ones 5 times in a row. We all know that maps in valorant have a lot of problems and frustrating areas. Having chance to play same map 5 or even 20 times in a row make this problem even bigger.

Because if its pure random system, everytime you queue every map has 25% chance of being chosen, that means you can theoretically play only one map over and over and there's NOTHING you can do about it. And its not really fun when you want to have fun competitive evening with friends and you play one map five times in a row.

Instead i propose simple pseudorandom system.

After you play map, your chance of getting that same map drops in half, so its 12.5%, if you get the same map again , its 6.25% and so on. Or it can drop even more or have assigned different parameters after playing, based on playtime etc..

This way it will feel more random and be more fun for everyone.

And btw: Apple had this same problem when itunes came out, their shuffle feature used true random system and people were complaining that it picked same songs over and over because there was a chance for it to happen. After complaints, they made it pseudorandom so when song was played, its chance of playing again soon dropped radically.


EDIT:

Lot of people are saying that this is not possible or it is problem because there are 10 players and only four maps and everyone played different map last game.

This is not a problem at all. Here’s why:

System would just match together players that played same maps last game and pick one of other three for that game.

That would be basically like you manually picking three out of four maps, but system will pick that three for you. This would result in slightly longer queue times. For example in cago you can solo queue just one map and you are just fine, and in this pseudorandom system you are queueing for three maps.

There is only ONE situation where this doesn’t work. If you play in four stack and each of you played different map last game, which will result in random map. But that is rare situation.",VALORANT,"Suggestion: Map picking shouldn’t be random, but instead pseudorandom."

With ""Vulnerable"" applied, each bullet's damage is doubled!

For example, with ""Vulnerable"", a Classic can deal 156 damage one-shot headshot full body armor over 30m distance!

# Thoughts

This could be very useful on pistol rounds. Viper can buy 2 mollies and one smoke and light armor. With the 2 mollies plus a classic and good aim (or good bursts), viper can disable any kind of full-team rush (especially on lower elo).

&amp;#x200B;

# EDIT: Combining Viper's Smoke and Molly

Combining those two will cause a compounded effect. Simple test was as follows:

1. Viper places molly, Enemy jett walks from side to side, Health = 62
2. Viper places molly and smoke, Enemy jett walks from side to side, Health = 39 !",VALORANT,"This is how Viper's ""Vulnerable"" debuff works"

You have it on random, and every game, it picks a skin you own to be that skin for the game. I just think this would be better than just having to choose one skin and only one skin.

1355,The_GameJoker,1595528217,hwkun9,48,27,"Like it or not, there's a lot of toxicity in Valorant and not everyone wants to deal with it. This means that plenty of players choose to mute team voice at the start of matches and simply use/respond to pings, (which, along with minimap-watching, is perfectly viable in my opinion). Unfortunately, this method has one major issue -- the muter's teammates doesn't know the muter isn't listening, which often leads to even more inter-team toxicity and a bad experience for all players involved.

&amp;#x200B;

I think an icon that suggests a player has ""opted out"" of voice comms would be helpful for all involved -- Heroes of the Storm's voice chat is somewhat similar to this in that the UI tells you how many teammates actually joined the game's opt-in voice chat, meaning you know both who you're able to talk to and who you need to ping to communicate with. I don't think Valorant needs to switch to an opt-in voice model, but I do think an indicator of sorts would be helpful for both players that want to use voice and players that don't.   


What do you think?",VALORANT,There should be an icon that shows a teammate has muted comms
1356,Finger_Trapz,1595530279,hwljg7,17,26,"Its hard to put out a proper game theory on why this is or anything, but I just have an incredibly hard time having fun on these maps. This is coming from someone who doesn't really like playing ranked. I just want to have fun, relax, score some frags, etc. I don't care that much about being top 100 NA or something.


The maps are just *unfun*. The amount of times where you have to enter an area and be able to simultaneously check two corners on opposite sides of you is ridiculous. It feels like sometimes I have to have literal pro-league coordination with my team to take sites, so that we all push in from multiple angles at the same time and know which corners we're checking. 

Its not enjoyable to have to push on C site on Haven and have to check both my left and right side. There are so many angles in the game that require 270 degree vision. There are so many places that people can just camp and at a minimum get a 1 person trade, maybe more. 


Defensive utility also feels far more powerful than offensive utility. Some places feel quite literally impossible to push against certain defenders. I often times hear that Cypher counts as 2 defenders in 1, but Sage can hold down sites on Haven and Split entirely on her own. I can pop every single one of my abilities as Brimstone on C Haven or B split, including my ultimate, but it doesn't matter when Sage just slows + walls us off and gives enough time for her entire team to rotate. 


The game just feels like long hallways with a few open areas dotted around which all conveniently are just massive chokepoints/funnels. I feel like a rat running through a maze except every fourth corner have a flamethrower pointing at me. These claustrophobic scenarios also conveniently tend to play perfectly into the hands of the Operator. 


Its annoying that there really isn't a single position in the game an OP isn't good in defensively except playing a forward position in Hookah on Bind or playing a forward position in B site on Ascent.

A site heaven on every single map? Perfect. Looking down the hallway on A site Split? Perfect. Looking into garage on B site Split? Also good. Peeking mid from vents on Split? Again, viable position. B site tower? Also works. 


Its amazing that even with the attempts at creativity like including 3 bomb plants and teleporters, the maps still end up being hallways upon more fucking hallways.

I don't understand who you are trying to appeal to, riot has been using the term  
""competitive integrity"" a whole lot, but so many things about these little mechanics just speaks against it.   
1. Inconsistent spray patterns that cannot be controlled for whatever reason  
2. First bullet inaccuracy to this extent has no place in a competitive shooter  
3. Spray reset takes an enormous amount of time making rushes extremely deadly, but for the completely wrong reasons.  
4. Sheriff not being oneshot headshot past 30m(something that takes good aim yet is not rewarded in any way)  
5. Having an operator in a game where there is:  
\*first bullet inaccuracy meaning dueling a long range operator isn't reliable  
\*at most 4 flashes per round  
\*at most 2 Molotovs per round (assuming you dont play brim, phoenix and viper)  
\*slow movement speed making defender operator extremely effective when holding.All this together is what i think is the result of this operator meta.

  
I would really like to hear riots response as to why all of this exists in a game  
made to be competitive.",VALORANT,What is the purpose of first bullet inaccuracy?

**This is evident when you receive lethal damage while dashing.** What occurs is the zoomed out camera will **show your character briefly dashing to point B, but then quickly just teleport back to point A as a corpse**. Another variation being your dead body will just do a little hop in place. 

Honestly have zero clue why this occurs, or if its even a bug to begin with. It's honestly hilarious, but can be frustrating at times since it sometimes feels like you've definitely dashed before the shot connected, but still take damage/chip damage. *Maybe this can be Valorant's version of being CS:GO'd.*

1382,Kilthua,1595534990,hwn2e9,5,13,"Here's a quick rundown of what I consider to be gamesense in Valorant, its very rough but I hope it can help someone who's struggling to understand its concept. (I'm Immortal 1, if that matters)

Gamesense 101

Gamesense is a skill in all FPS games that determines how aware a player is at any point in a game about the current situation/status of themselves and opponents given information that they are able to gather either themselves or through teammates. There is also a degree of intuition from information that you do not know where you must be either able to guess/predict to give you an advantage, the better your gamesense, the greater the advantage.

Basics of gamesense:

* Knowing where you are in relation to your team
* Knowing where you are in relation to your enemy
* Knowing where the enemy is and will go
* Knowing your current situation (are you advantageous or disadvantageous), your utility, their utility, your HP vs their HP
* Knowing the map your are playing, know roughly how long it takes to rotate between sites and plant, know the common plant positions and what they are planted for

Scenario: Haven, You are on Defender Side

Your team has called an enemy team A execute, you see on the map that the site has been smoked so you don't know how many are coming from either Long/Short. Since the number of players taking the site is unknown, you must always assume that not every player will be taking site, here is where gamesense comes into play, from the previous rounds you have played, you need to determine if the enemy is aggressive or passive in their playstyle and executes, if the former, be aware that there may be a player aggressively lurking looking to flank the backlines while the defenders rotate, if they are more passive, be aware if you yourself are flanking, they may be holding deep angles waiting for your push.

1 v X Scenario You should be asking yourself, how do I set-up as many 1v1 scenarios as possible with either my utility, positioning or communication gained from teammates.

X v 1 Scenario Always have your teammates in view or be in a position to trade them, DO NOT give the enemy a chance to take 1v1 duels, hold crossfires and communicate what you are holding, think about how you would approach this from the opposite perspective, take the optimal positioning/try to have a wall against your back or teammate.

Thank you for reading this far, I hope any of this information can help you in your competitive matchmaking!",VALORANT,Gamesense 101

1404,cakedayonceevry4year,1595550359,hwrl7c,69,232,"Thought this might be useful, I’m not an expert but I’m sharing what worked for me at least.

1. Don’t just play the game, don’t just practice and play the game, while playing the game, focus on how you died, eg: I shot him twice in the chest but he shot me once in the head, then think why that happened, so in this case my crosshair placement wasn’t good and then try to work on that. Try to catch yourself if you aim lower down at the ground until it becomes natural.

2. In each game, if someone makes good call outs and is playing well, send them a friend request. Even if only 1/10 people accept, you could find at least a few after a week. Before playing competitive matches, invite them all and you can play better knowing you’re in safe hands.

3. Try not to get disheartened by your rank. Considering I play quite a lot, I felt like I was hard stuck bronze forever, but I climbed from bronze three to silver 2 in a day and got to gold a week later. While it takes a while, the matchmaking system will eventually recognise if your skill is a lot higher then the people you play against.

4. To rank up, sometimes you shouldn’t be trying to play how you see your favourite streamers like Hiko or Shroud play the game, as although that’s how everyone would dream to play like, they play a lot differently according to different opponents, better aim, etc. If you’re in bronze, play like a silver, if you’re in silver, play like a gold. Sometimes you have to mindlessly frag your way out of a rank.

5. This one is more speculation than fact, but I feel that at least from Iron to Gold, ranks are split into two groups: Iron and Bronzes, and Silvers and Golds. 
At the very least I often played with irons in bronze and immediately played with golds after pushing to silver 1, and I have only ever played with one plat at gold 2. It is a lot harder to rank out of bronze than silver imo because you are playing with different players, so don’t get disheartened if you’re struggling.",VALORANT,Just some tips from how I got to bronze to gold since starting Valorant.

1408,rhysvplayer,1595597371,hx1sz2,108,102,,VALORANT,Rhys - best clips stuck in immortal 3 second part
1409,Eraen,1595588310,hwzpyo,168,96,"I see a ton of posts about:

* Radianite points being the manifestation of evil
* Skin prices being the manifestation of pure greed
* Battlepass being the grindiest thing they've ever seen in the known universe

None of these, I repeat, NONE of these affect how enjoyable Valorant is, because it's a tactical shooter designed to give satisfaction via clean visuals, complex strategical thinking and teamplay.

There are currently several problems that DO affect gameplay, such as:

* Clunky hit-registration in some specific situations
* MMR system being a mystery and the source of a lot of frustration (for both us, players, and presumably for those at Riot - as they admitted there's noone fine-tuning/fixing it at the moment)
* The obligatory smurf infestation that every popular online competitive game faces.
* Operator being overly-dominant in higher tier play, reducing the strategic elements of the game.

This sub, and the game's fans participating here claim that they love/like/care for the game, but their choice of topic when posting here paints a different picture.

I will get downvoted to hell with this post, and that's okay. I truly don't care about useless internet points, but about the game that has the potential to be better. It eventually will, but not via posting about irrelevant stuff.

Edit: I added Operator meta to the list.",VALORANT,UNPOPULAR OPINION: This sub is losing focus on what's really important - things that actually affect the gameplay.

1412,neofederalist,1595593709,hx0vrp,223,61,"It seems like one of this sub's pet issues is ""we need more maps, not more agents"" and while I agree that 4 maps is too few for interesting and varied gameplay, I can't help but feeling that people are thinking too small with the kinds of things that characters in this sort of game can potentially do.  It's understandable that people compare this game to Counter Strike and think ""we've got flashes, smokes, and mollies"" and while those kinds of abilities do provide proven and effective utility for the gameplay of a tactical shooter, a variety of agents with drastically different abilities adds an entirely different level to the game. Anyone who has played LoL and has ever done the 5 support comp, or 5 tank comp knows what I'm talking about here. Those examples are cheesy and don't work at the highest levels of competitive play, but even professionally, you see different kinds of team comps (poke comp, deathball, protect the hyper-carry, etc.) all with different strengths and weaknesses that create varied and interesting gameplay. 

I'm just going to list out here some examples of types of agent abilities that we might see in the future:

* Ally buffs - Right now we basically have Sage's heal/rez and Brimstone's stim beacon, but there's a ton that could be done here. Damage amplifiers, attack speed amplifiers, movement speed buffs, buffs to ally abilities (making AOEs larger, etc). And multiply all these with the different ways allies can be effected. They can be targeted on a single ally, affect a set part of the map, affect allies near you etc.
* Enemy debuffs - Right now, we have slows, flashes and ares of vision denial, but anything you could do to buff allies, you could do in reverse to debuff enemies. You can also do things like LoL silence (prevent them from using abilities), ways to force displacement of enemies, etc.
* Affecting terrain - Right now we only have Sage wall, but we could potentially have all sorts of terrain generation or terrain destruction. Imagine abilities that let you create a ramp or ladder that let your allies get to places they couldn't otherwise reach, or abilities that open portals through terrain.
* Shields - Abilities that could block bullets, projectiles, or enemy abilities, walls that prevent movement through, but not bullets, etc.
* Trickery - Abilities that create decoys or clones. Abilities that change your character model and even hitbox. Abilities that mess with the enemy minimap, or even comms
* Adding effects to bullets - We see this a little bit with the tracer rounds in spike rush, but you could potentially add any sort of debuff on hit
* Movement - We have teleports, dashes, and jumps already, but we could have agents that walk up or hang from walls or ceilings
* Econ effecting - Characters could have abilities that reduce the cost of ally guns or abilities, agents could start with a particular gun, you could steal money from the opposing team, or increase the amount of money you get from kills or defuses.
* Stacking abilities - Abilities could increase in power as the game goes on, or from kills, spike plants, defuses, or orb collection

Note that some of the things I've listed here are almost certainly unfun, or create play patterns that are counter to the overall design goals of the game (I've avoided mentioning anything ""melee"" here  or damaging abilities for that reason). I'm just rattling off these kinds of things because Riot really hasn't even scratched the surface of the kinds of abilities they could in principle give agents.",VALORANT,"I feel like the people saying ""we don't need more agents"" are drastically underestimating the amount of design space there is for character creation"

You don't! Don't let people tell you you shouldn't enjoy playing casually, or make you feel bad for posting clips that don't look like you're shroud or some shit. 

It's okay to just play for fun and have a good time. As a community I think we should embrace casual play rather than trying to turn the community into some toxic sweaty cess pool. 

To the people constantly shitting on casual players that post here, shame on you. Keep the negativity to yourself. The game was literally designed to bring in both casual and competitive players.

1426,shini-chan,1595609859,hx5gdo,32,30,"Just a rant. I see people being toxic when they're winning or it's only round 3.

Valorant isn't my first rodeo, used to play a LOT of CSGO with my friends, still go back to it occasionally. maybe its just because the counter strike crowd is older but it was rare to see people toxic while winning.

got carried by my friends to LEM when they took the game more seriously and got their globals. kind of regret not playing more religiously then and so valorant is like my second wind. i do find lots of awesome wholesome people in every other game. but i feel like its worth talking about how to enjoy losing games as part of the process.

now generally, i see two reasons ppl play fps:

1. to git gud.
2. social thing with friends.

**For those that want to git gud.** It is super important to enjoy losing to get better. If you're winning then you're playing against people that are worse than you. its why stomps are nice once in a while, but the game would get very boring if the opposing team were just complete noobs all the time.

if you want to git gud as fast as possible then in a perfect world:

1. you get absolutely stomped **while** giving your all in a game,
2. next you figure out all the things that went wrong,
3. suddenly absorb all that info and modify your play,
4. then face another even stronger team
5. rinse and repeat
6. PROFIT

By definition, a win will always mean less growth than a loss, because you will generally learn more from your mistakes the more of them you make.

honestly, **learn to love getting wrecked**. the only way to truly do this is to be able to figure out why you are getting wrecked. you can't really tell if someone is hacking or is playing really well, so its super easy to be frustrated. but when you can see how and why people are playing well you will be in awe of their talent. respecting the good opponents is part of the game, because you have to play around that. if you think their lucky, you're gonna play riskier and that can mean more losing.

it's always better to assume people are playing well because it means, you as a player can grow the most when attempting to overcome them. the more godlike they appear they greater you can potentially become when you overcome them; you may falsely figure out some sick strat and become a legend even if they actually are hacking.

there have been games where the enemy team had a counter strat to everything we did. they read us like books and played us like violins for the first quarter, it was brilliant. so clean, and crisp. and every time we thought back to the previous round, it made sense how and why they moved and pushed the places they did. the smoke positioning, the timings, the double peaking, ooff, it was majestic.

even getting a single round off them was brilliant. and once we figured them out, it ended up being a super close game.

***if you can't appreciate a good loss, you won't be able to play as much as the people that do, hence nor grow as much as they can.***

If the enemy team is clutching a 1v5, a part of you should be disappointed, but another part of you should be uwu'ing off the face of the earth. that doesnt mean you want it to happen, show the enemy some respect, give it your all to shut them down. and then slow clap or say 'ns' or 'well played sir' if they out do you. and ofc taunt them if they fail.

**What about cheaters**? There is no greater feeling than awping a wall hacker or out playing an aimbot. sure the game is going to be super hard, but it reminds me of shonen moments where the protagonist is meant to die/lose but some quirk saves him; and part of the story is having to flesh out that unique ability later on. Eventually, *you* can draw out that hyper sense ability you acquired from these unfair matchups in fair decent games. I remember there was a saying that if you wanted to get to global elite (the highest cs rank) you had to pass that superhuman bot level. remember the tougher the challenge the more it reflects how superb you have to be. **and in a way its a compliment to your ability that win.exe is needed to beat you**

sure you could get all anxious, and not even want to play. a spin bot really doesn't have any solutions; perhaps the only thing you can learn are unknown wallbang spots. it may feel like if you try you'll end up looking like a fool. but genuinely try your best, you want to lose feeling like you could've beat the hacker rather than being sad there was a hacker in the game, and you never know until you are giving your all if you can beat them.

what if your team sucks? **if you're playing with your friends,** remind yourself it doesn't really matter about the game. ask them if they're enjoying themselves, if not and they want to take it seriously don't be afraid to try and give constructive advice, like why don't we try X or you were pretty good at Y but I think you should do Z. if they actually are enjoying the games, troll a bit more, have fun, try strat roulette. **if you personally want to rank up more, get an alt!**

**if you're playing with randoms** and they suck, see if theres any advice you can give to help them. and be friendly. sometimes the mm thinks it's your turn to carry a game. again be friendly, throw in ""nice trys"" everywhen. if theyre being toxic, practice defusing the situation especially if someone is being toxic to someone else, super useful skill, both in-game and in life. if you cant and its affecting your game just mute them. hopefully, they'll be on the enemy team next game, and THEN you can trash talk as muuuuuuuuuuuch as you want.

**directing your toxicity to the enemy can work too**. obviously be nice at the gg. but tbagging, trash talking are great ways to tilt people and win. I would argue it is part of the game because even at the pro-level getting in your opponent's head is a big part of the game. plus I always love me some drama as long as its all well and good in the backrooms.

**what if your aim sucks?** perfect opportunity to build game sense, you need to camp in unexpected corners; use shotguns, maybe flank the enemy team. use double peaks when defending, act as bait, work on your callouts, look at the minimap more. this is like the perfect time to hone your game sense. your goal is to use your brain to figure out the easiest shots you can take. when your aim comes back, you will be an even better player.

**what if everything sucks?** its okay to have bad days, i think people play video games to escape something. and not being able to improve your mmr can feel bad. its nice to climb, but if you keep coming back down, it feels like you've wasted your time. kind of like falling to the bottom in games like jump knight. remember though, each time you learn something different. and its not really your mmr that determines how good of a player you are. instead its the other way round, how good of a player you are determines your mmr. so maybe all you really need to do is sit down and look at your past games, see what you're doing wrong and try and fix those. just spam queueing isn't going to make you feel any better. ***you*** need to change before your mmr does.

**last thing**. this is hisoka:

As sage.

My team was all over the place, and I was almost always the one going in first. I would try to hang back and let others push, but it was so uncoordinated. I had omen push, even breach would push with me, but our two duelists would wait for us to clear the way.

Stop. Doing. This. Duelists have abilities that give you an advantage on a push. Especially Phoenix with his flashes. Jetts main ability can almost give you a free pick if you use it right. Peek, shoot, dash behind cover. I’m more than willing to peek behind you as support or heal you if you get dinked, but I don’t have such abilities when I play sage.

Sage is good for locking down a site, creating chokepoints and slowing down the enemy so that everyone can get into position and start getting picks. Whether it be on attack or defend.

If you want to play a duelist, you gotta take the responsibilities that come with it. Which means everyone else should be supporting you, not you supporting the support.

Yes, I did say I’m a raze main. If there’s a pick, I rush so I can lay down a bot or even use satchels to get into mid or back of site so we get quick control. I just don’t play a duelist if we already have two of them.

So please, do everyone a favor. Play your strengths. If you’re not comfortable being aggressive, don’t play an aggressive character, forcing people who are aggressive to play a support character aggressively.",VALORANT,"As a Raze main, please stop instalocking duelists if you’re not going to use your abilities to push."

1438,Calamity-Swain,1595609037,hx57hg,25,20,"Hey guys,

Just wanted to give an opinion on some of the community in this game and maybe some (obvious, but kind) words of wisdom for some others. I hope it’ll change your outlook on your team mates.

Firstly, to all of you 1000+ hour CS pro’s or whatever other FPS you’ve come from. Please understand we aren’t all coming from the same background. Valorant is my first ever FPS and also my first ever PC game. 

I’ve, over time, learned the meaning of certain callouts (T, CT, U- Hall, etc.) but still, from time to time, the call out escapes my mind and i just use whatever name is on the map. One bad callout doesn’t warrant you to shout at said player. Just correct them and hopefully they’ll remember for next time. 

Secondly, inconsistency doesnt warrant you moaning/shouting. Once again, we’re not all coming from FPS backgrounds and dont all have perfect accuracy with hours in aim trainers. Im floating around Diamond 1/2 and some games i match with and will top frag vs Immortals. Other games my aim is barely worthy of Gold. I have 2 things to say about this. 1, if you’re the person who is having a bad game use your economy to help the team, buy your fragger weapons and go without if necessary. 2, if you notice someone having a bad game, dont give them shit. Encourage! I for one perform worse when team mates are getting on my back! Additionally to this point you guys need to understand, because we all aren’t skilled CS pro’s like so many are, we don’t all have perfect execute skills, plant skills or post plant skills. Just encourage one another and you’ll hopefully win the game hut if not, would have helped a team mate. 

Lastly, the Valorant LFG discord can work well, but i’ve had countless bad experiences. As we all know SoloQ is somewhat annoying and very tedious. So, if you’re like me and have 0 PC friends you have to SoloQ or LFG. Please, please, if you’re making an LFG group and pick someone up who has a bad game i understand if you drop them but don’t just tell them they’re shit and to ‘f off’. Give them some advice on what to work on and how to work on it and then part ways. Simple. 

Sorry for the rant and i appreciate if you’ve read this far. 

Yours sincerely, 

A kind Boomer ☺️",VALORANT,Opinions/Advice for experienced and Non experienced FPS players

1441,NexYT,1595572581,hwwvvq,2,16,"Something I’ve seen a lot on Reddit is people (presumably newer/lower ranked players) being ‘timing’d’ (pushed while turning around, peeking while somebody just came to watch) and they often put it to luck or chance and that it was just bad timing.

I think this is completely inaccurate 95% of the time. You were probably killed due to a change in the gamestate.

Think about it as, literally, the state of the round/game. When something happens, the gamestate changes. If someone pushes and takes map control, if map control is lost, a kill occurs, an ability is used, these all result into a change of the gamestate and as such, most, if not all, players on the server have to react. 

When something happens and you think “I should turn to watch something else”, you have probably reacted due to a change in the gamestate and as such, so has the player who pushed ‘randomly’.

The way to counter this is to anticipate events when the gamestate changes. If you take mid control on Haven, take the initiative to realise they will try and take map control elsewhere, expect it and punish it.

If a teammate is killed, the other team will probably commit to taking control where the kill is. As such, take initiative and take map control but know that there may be someone watching as they may understand this idea.

Is that you?

I constantly see players dying because they have this bad habit of immediately reloading after every kill.

This is one of the worst habits to have if you're trying to climb to higher ranks because the higher you get the more often you're gonna get punished for it.

It's not just that you can not shoot when someone comes around while you're reloading but most importantly your reload gives a massive sound queue to your opponent. 

Any player who listens to sounds properly can immediately locate you and quickly come around to kill you.

So really start choosing your time to reload carefully and become more confident in yourself to hit your shots even on low ammo.

I've compiled a few example clips from my games in Immortal where the last bullets were just enough or I played whole rounds without reloading once.

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/689215446

I can honestly say I never lose rounds because I didn't have enough bullets in my clip. When I see I only got 3 bullets left it turns on that extra focus and actually makes me hit more of those shots.

But to get to these skins, you must upgrade a gun reload animation or a VFX or even a finisher. For example, to get the purple/dark skin for the elderflame OP, you must upgrade the VFX, the animation, and also the finisher. I think RIOT should give you an option to turn specific animation upgrades on and off just like how you can switch which skin is on the gun. Personally, I don't like how the elderflame OP is pulled out when upgraded, BUT I love the VFX it gives and also the finisher; and also, I like the skin options.

1467,BillzXD,1595575076,hwxd82,14,9,"Before getting into Valorant I was a longtime League player, playing on and off since Season 2. One of the big factors that led to me quitting earlier this year was that I felt Riot would never change their ways and start giving legitimate punishments to players who are clearly griefing (not just having a bad game) or AFK'ing games. I've really been enjoying Valorant, but I still feel that these issues are just as bad here.

AFK'ing feels like a huge problem right now, there will be days when every game or two there's an AFK on a team, just the other day I ff'd for the first time when we had to play a 3v5. What's the punishment for this? A short (I've heard from 5 minutes to an hour) matchmaking cooldown. An hour? That's it? You effectively ruin a game for 4 people and your punishment is you have to do something else for an hour? When I first started playing League I AFK'd one time, and got an instant 24 hour ban, thousands of games later and I've never intentionally AFK'd again.

I will concede that Riot is having serious client/server issues atm, I've gotten error codes that kick me a few times, so until that stabilizes I can understand why they dont wanna be banning dudes for AFK's, but is this an excuse for griefing?

 I just played a game where my botfrag gold 1 omen blamed the two silvers who were doing better than him for ""baiting him"", and he proceeded to grief for 12 the next 12 rounds. A 9-3 stomp turned into a 13-12 clutch because one guy decided he didn't want us to win anymore; he'd sit in base with staring at corners, wouldn't move even when he had bomb, intentionally smoked/flashed us on pushes. What do I expect will happen? Absolutely nothing. Having played league for years I know that nothing will happen for griefing unless a dude is reported a billion times, and then if he does get punished it's not gonna be for more than a week.

At what point will Riot actually step in and punish players who ruin the game for others? They're so afraid of losing potential customers that they alienate their dedicated players.",VALORANT,When will Riot start giving actual punishments?

Obsidian was born in the core of the earth, after 37 years the first light had struck. He grew up in a civilisation called rockilians. They roamed the depths of the Earth trying to live peacefully against their enemies, zelons, who could control metals. The zelons had terrorized the rockilians for years until the rockilians created a group of warriors called the Almighty, to protect their culture and people. One day, the zelons raided a rockilian town and murdered Obsidians parents. From that day on he had done whatever it takes to protect others. After a couple years of trying to protect other rockilians, he was invited to the Almighty however there was a blast of lava that shot him straight up to the surface of Earth, where he was now partially made up out of molten lava. Valorant had been trying to track him down for years until Obsidian had found them. From that moment on Obsidian had been a part of Valorant.

First Ability (C) - Rock Shatter - 2 uses - $200

Upon activation, it Summons a rock in his hands from the ground beneath him. Upon pressing the ability button again, he casts his rock onto any floor or wall and when an enemy walks on it or next to it, it damages and dazes the player for 2 seconds.

Like cypher trap but instead of info it damages. Only sound queue no detection.

Second Ability (Q) - Molten Lava - 2 uses - $200

Upon activation, he reaches into the ground and picks up some some hot rock, when you press ""lmb"" he throws the rock onto the floor/surface and activates the molten lava. The molten lava does 50dps when stood in it and it gives a burning de-buff once stepped of of it for 3 seconds. The melting de-buff does 10dps.

It is like viper's snakebite but instead of vulnerability it gives burning. Brimstone's molly is 60dps which is 15 damager per 0.25 seconds.

Signature Ability (E) - Rock Pillar - 2 uses - regenerates every 30 seconds

Brings a pillar of rock on a suggested marker which can boost a teammate or himself onto an elevated position. It has 350hp but does not take damage over time.

Like Sage's Wall but stays there for whole round but can not be used to delay enemies but just to elevate yourself.

Ultimate Ability (X) - Crystalize

Upon activation Obsidian turns into Crystal for 4 seconds to regenerate all health whilst adding an extra 50 . His abilities and weapons do 15% less damage. The bonus stays until he takes enough damage to break his crystal shield.

NOT MY ARTWORK - him with his ultimate active - head still crystal but body is rock when not active

My problem with it is that any team that’s halfway decent is going to be listening for the enemy Omen as soon as they hear “scatter.” When I’m on defense, if you Ult out to flank you are giving up a crucial angle that you are holding (and the other team is going to be checking their flank for you anyways). If it’s a fake and you Ult to help at A, you basically give up B completely and vice versa. 

On offense the Ult isn’t super helpful on Bind, Ascent, and Split. I’ve Ult’d to probably every site there and I’m lucky to get one pick so my team can advance before the defense takes me out. My one caveat is I think the Ult is a lot more useful on Haven since it’s a more spread out map. 

Then you look at the Ult points. Valorant is basically saying Omen’s Ult is more useful than Phoenix getting a free life to charge forward onto a site for a pick and equally useful to Sage being able to res a teammate.

For me, Omens Ult has basically turned into a Sova recon arrow. I just Ult onto site to gain info on where the enemy team is and then cancel before I get one tapped to the dome. 

I’m not really sure how I would change Omens Ult if I could, but when I mess around in spike rush/unrated with other agents I feel like I get way more use out of their Ult.",VALORANT,Is Omen’s Ult the worst in the game after Vipers buff?

The slurping, the kissing noises, the rude questions and disgusting side comments. It’s cringe and there’s nothing more annoying than hearing you treat a male teammate using voicechat normally and with respect, but the minute I open my mouth, I get a totally different response. I’m not asking for much, just to be treated equal. 

It’s got to the point now where I just tell a guy who’s being overly crude I’m 13, and sometimes that’s not even enough to deter him (kind of worrying). I get there’s trolls and I know a ton of people will tell me not to use voice chat, but couldn’t guys just actively try not make girls feel uncomfortable? Communication helps teams win, it’s a fact. And I want to be part of it. Yes, it’s the internet, and I probably should just shut up and get used to it, but that doesn’t make it right.

Humans called it the first light. A mysterious substance called radianite struck the earth. It quickly devoured the things around it, including people. Those who had come in contact with this sheer elemental energy were called radiants, people with superhuman abilities. However, the radiants didn’t know their power and as such, chaos ensued. Crime was at an all time high, the world was already ravaged by the first light and it couldn’t handle the sheer amount of people who now had unprecedented power. There was still hope, though, as a company called the Kingdom created a shadow organization called the VALORANT protocol. It recruited agents, comprised of both radiants and non-radiants. However, these people were in desperate need of training and as such, were cloned and put into teams. These teams would then fight in controlled locations and were given one objective or the other. Plant the spike, a radianite powered bomb, or defuse and protect various sites. This training method proved effective and the teams were dispatched to various areas to help control the radiants and sometimes recruit agents.

1592,Kletra,1595677411,hxlea1,23,2,"This is  something I've been suffering my whole life with different online games. When I was in high school I would get a massive win with decent mechanics on league of legends and after that I just couldn't hit the play again button. From the starting of the day I would play until I get a very nice score and a win and that's it. Note that this only happens when I win a game, there is no problem until I get a satisfying win but once I get it I just can't hit the play again button, not at least before taking a 15 mins breaktime. 

I am writing this right after a valorant game where I was the top frag with 23/3/5 KDA and a 13-1 win. After that, I couldn't hit the play again button at the bottom of the score screen. As a result I was too scared to play again and I quit the game and started writing this. 

This causes a huge problem for me and that is the loss of warm up. I know if I play a game right after such a beatiful game, the chances are high that I win another one with that warmed up and ultra focused mind state. Instead I just quit the game and wait for at least 15 mins (sometimes it extends to 1 hour until I feel ready again) to lose my warm up to play worse the next match I play.

What could be the reason for this and how can I overcome it? Any reply is appreciated.",VALORANT,Why am I so scared to play another game after I win a game with a good KDA?

Even if what you are doing with your utility or decision making is making a huge impact on the game if you don't frag out it just doesn't matter for your rank.  You can be just absolutely buttering up the other team by forcing them out of position, cutting off their sightlines so your teammates can get better positioning to take those advantageous fights, swinging wide so your teammate can get the trade.

1629,porochew,1595794172,hydsk5,0,1,"Following the latest info I could find (Ask VALORANT #2 from July 2nd), it seems pretty clear integrated cross-region play isn’t all too likely. However, that Q&amp;A does mention they’re “keeping an eye on demand”, and since I haven’t seen anyone asking for it publicly - here goes! I’d also like to suggest a couple ways to allow this without affecting the competitive aspect of the game, which is clearly important to the devs and community alike.

All that said, I also think it’s important to address the fact that people are already doing this. It’s not all that difficult to set up an account in a different region, and ultimately people do want to play with their friends. In some cases, this may even be necessary to play in the first place!

CS:GO, if I remember correctly, has an option to queue for a certain ping - you can fine tune your threshold and only get matches with players below it. This has some flaws - setting a default threshold could cause issues across the board, from ruining competitive games in well supported regions to barring off players who don’t have the option for lower ping games (e.g. Africa, South-East Asia, etc). With some fine tuning however, I think this could be viable - in fact, something as simple as no ping cap for Unrated and a configurable (or hard!) cap for Competitive could be perfect. This allows people to play with their friends and gives competitive players more control than they currently have. The default value for this cap would need serious consideration of course, but I think it could be done well.

Other options are possible - different settings per region, per gamemode, etc. I understand it’s a complex issue, but better systems are definitely possible and worth looking into!
Any suggestions other people have are encouraged and overall I’d like to just get the conversation going to see if people are supportive of the current system or not. Thanks!",VALORANT,Ideas for cross-region play

Back then, there are lots of my friend and some other people with lower rank levels want me to help them get the GrandMaster as 4000 OW rank reward. So they all come to me and let me help them to get the  Rank Season head portrait and the Painting. Me and my other teammate who use to play start using their account to play. We can beat the player can't even contest us and the account owner can get the reward they want. we happy and they happy. Because VALORANT is a free game and everyone can find a balance between competing and just have fun. So I just don't want VALORANT Rank to become like OVERWATCH. Because I know some dark shit in Overwatch Rank in China. Things like Smurf or Boosting happen all the time. But the most shocking thing is some high-rank players they have a group and they agreed to match at the same time in the mid-night. so they can get in the same match So they can manipulate the whole match. If someone says they want to win in their group. They can act and do some black casework to let the guy who gives money to them to win. I really don't want account trade and Boosting in the game become popular and ordinary in VALORANT. So I think the rank reward even not necessary. Because to be good and have fun in-game is already a nice reward. And the environment in competitive is pretty good right now. Please be careful with the rank reward and I really hope this game can be better day by day

My approach so far has been to put more of my POV focus on attacker side, and when round starts I tend to pick an area I think a clash is bound to happen based on the mini map. (Ie I see 2-3 guys on each side approaching mid on bind)

If this big engage happens then I’ll press V to go into drone mode and do my best to get a wide angle of all this firefight. 

As players get picked off I’ll try to just pick players who I think have to carry the game on their shoulders. Ie if the bomb carrier hasn’t planted the spike I’ll focus on him as the round is predicated on him planting  or if there’s 1 - 2 guys left on defense I’ll just jump between the two of them since if they die they lose. 


Ultimately, there are times when there are firefights at both bomb sites and I’ll miss quite a few frags. 

Looking for any tips right now on how I can improve on the specutating experience for our stream viewers of the tourney. 

Ps
I use all the numerical hot keys for players as well as the mouse buttons, and I use the V key for the drone perspective.

1797,Sedonis,1595813757,hyj4e0,6,1,"Let me get this out of the way, I am in no way great at the game, but the things I am talking about aren't directly related to gameplay. These are just my thoughts on the game, however bad they may be. I am currently Gold 3 but don't really play this game a ton, which is where my gripes with the game start. Just a warning, this is a long post, there is a TLDR at the end if you don't want to read.

I play games for fun, not obligation. The current length of the battlepass feels like an obligation. I shouldn't have to play \~3 games a day to fulfill the battlepass. There are many other games that I would like to play. Dedicating a portion of my day to playing Valorant just to fulfill the battlepass makes me not want to play the game. Sure, the 10$ battlepass is a pretty OK deal. You get a handful of decent skins and a good amount of Radianite. But good lord, spending what seems like 100 hours just to get these items feels awful. I also play a decent amount of TFT, hovering around diamond 4, where I have also bought the battlepass. I have not played a ton of TFT this season because I just genuinely feel the patches are pretty inconsistent, but that isn't the point. The point is as I stated above, ""I have not played a ton of TFT."" I have not played a ton, and I have missed a multitude of weekly missions worth hundreds of XP to the battlepass... but I am almost done with it. I have at no point felt like ""I need to play TFT for the battlepass..."" There are just enough weekly missions, and xp given out at the end of a game to just... have enough for playing if it's only 1 game a day. Despite all of this, I do believe that the battlepass is CLOSE to being a battlepass that I would buy again. If they just shaved off even 1k from each tier, or even slightly more than 1k, it would be great. That's 50k off, or about a weeks worth of XP if you play as much as I do.  


The other hot topic is the price of skins. For comparison I will be taking Riot's other game, League of Legends. Looking at Valorant, you have skins that are either a balanced price, usually the ones without upgrades. And the skins with upgrades. Now... the problem isn't the price of the skin in my opinion, it's Radianite. When the dragon skins came out, I thought $92 was a bit overpriced, but I was on the verge of thinking of it as acceptable. HOWEVER, I saw a reddit post how upgrading the whole pack would run you $292... That's fucking absurd. In no world would I ever pay $292 for fully upgraded skins. Take a look at League of Legends now. There is currently a bundle in the shop containing 5 champions, 5 skins, one for each of the champions, 2 ward skins, and 5 icons running for 11250 RP. This makes it so you have to buy the $100 pack. Well now take a look at what each of the skins offers. FULL VFX, sounds, backing animations, and emotes... The $100 pack of RP gives you 15,000 RP. You buy the full pack, you still have around 4,000 RP left over. The difference between Valorant and League is atronomical, even when it's the same company. Now let me run some comparisons past people. 1275 for an Avalance Vandal... pretty good skin in my opinion and I think it deserves it's price... until you look at comparisons. League of Legends runs good quality skins, complete with VFX, sounds, and the skin itself for a minimum of 1350. This requires you to get the $10 pack of RP for ALL VFX, sounds, and skin. Looking at a skin like the recent infernal skins (Karthus, Kennen, Vel' Koz). Take a look at Valorant. You are asking (\~$18, rounding up). Meaning you are going to have to buy the $20 pack for the Oni Phantom. Fine, that's acceptable in my opinion. Then add Radianite on top of that. You are going to have to buy the 5350, $50 VP pack in order to buy the 4800 pack of radianite. You are now looking at \~$70 for ONE skin, complete with VFX, Sound, and the skin itself. Quite frankly... it's fucking asburd. People using the ""it's a free to play game"" excuse are being a little blind, or just haven't played League of Legends for instance. League has quality skins, for about half the price if you are adding in Radianite. Once again, let me compare. I can get Infernal Karthus, complete with VFX, Sound and the skin for 1350 ($10). For the Oni Phantom, fully upgraded, with VFX and sound and the skin, you are looking at 1775 for the skin ($20 pack) and 4800 for 80 Radianite ($50 pack), for a total of $70 dollars. Yea.... no. Remove Radianite and I would be OK with the price of skins.  


Do I think Riot will change this? Absolutely not. There are already enough people buying them to make it a pretty clear case that they would not lower the price of skins. Do I think that they will lower requirements of the battlepass? Also no, they want people to play their game, whether they feel obligated or for fun.   


TL:DR Battlepass is too long and feels like an obligation. Even taking 1k xp off of each tier would go a long way I think. Skins are a balanced price... EXCEPT for Radianite upgrades. Radianite is a plague that should be removed. League of Legends offers skins complete with FULL VFX, sounds, backing animation and sometimes emotes for 1350... ($10). Compared to the new Oni Phantom which runs \~$70 for the same features.

Cosmos starts each game with 5 stars around him. To cast any of his abilities he may use one of the stars.
His abilities are:
1. Blinding Light - He uses one of the stars to cast a flash (he is not immune to the flash). He cand bend the flash like jett's smoke. The flash occurs in 1 second after the cast as a small shine of the star.
2. Dying Star - He uses one of the stars to cast a similar to the flash small star, that would implode and charge and then explode killing the enemies inside it.
3. Warming Light - He uses one of the floating stars to heal a teammate for 50 HP (the heal isnt instant and the star takes 2 seconds to reach the target, if the target dies the star will come back to Cosmos.

Ultimate: Stary night - The time changes to night and stars appear, after 2 seconds from the use of one of the 5 stars Cosmos has, a star from the sky becomes a galling star and replaces the used one for Cosmos, the floating star can be seen by the enemy team alerting the position of Cosmos. The night stays for 45 seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the situation:

I played Valorant back when the game was in beta/alpha, whatever you really want to call it, no issues at all. Some of my friends started playing a lot recently, so I thought I would maybe play again here a couple of days ago.

Completely fresh account, first game, we get to round 9 or 10 and I'm sitting at 3/8, still trying to learn the map and what each ability on the different agents. We get to this round and I get banned in my very first game ever playing, didn't make much sense to me, but whatever I'll just make a ticket.

The following day I get a reply to my ticket, saying this

&gt;*We investigated the account and confirmed that this is an account that is related to the usage of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in VALORANT. Because of that the account will remain permanently suspended.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Most cheating account bans also come with a hardware ban, these bans are not permanent and will be periodically reviewed. At release, we reviewed all existing hardware bans and unbanned some of the less egregious offenders. We are not planning to remove any more hardware bans until our next periodic review.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*We won't be able to go into the specifics of the investigation that lead to this suspension, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.*

If anyone working at Riot should end up reading this, the ticket number is "" **#51281262** ""

At this point I kinda figured out what might have flagged me, sadly it seem like I can't really test it seeing it looks like they handed out a hwid ban at the same time. Anyway, it turns out there is some kind software on a USB stick I've plugged into my PC, this USB is work related stuff, such as win10, drivers, office pack, cpuz, benchmark tests etc. However, the USB contains more serious software too related to my work (I work with problem solving within IT) which means the USB has a couple of what some might call ""*dodgy programs*"" to get around different functions within windows.

I've not gotten any reply to my ticket for a couple of days now, after they said I could just ask if I had any questions or concerns about the situation. Been able to provide Riot with the reason for the flag, just not the source, only they can tell me what on this USB is getting flagged.

I already send a dm to /u/RiotArkem but no reply yet. I'm currently uploading all content on the USB, which anyone from Riot is welcome to look at if they dm me. For obvious reasons I can't put the link to the content of the USB in here.",VALORANT,Falsely Banned

However, everyone seems to be glossing over the best agent in the game: cypher. Mark my words, this could change once Killjoy comes out, but Cypher is the best agent in the game right now. He is irreplaceable in pro play, with I think a 100% pickaxe in NA tourneys. Right now, Cypher is harder to counter without a cypher than the Operator. 

In my opinion, even at the very highest level the most an agent should be picked is 80 or 85% with 4 maps. Aka, slightly more than a one map exception. Even Sage is less used than Cypher, because of Ascent (and sometimes but extremely rarely Bind). 

It should not be a requirement at the most competitive level to pick any specific agent on the majority of the maps. We are supposed to pick from 5 agents, not 4. Lmk what you guys think, but imo even though Cypher is ""best"" he doesn't really feel broken, maybe just consistently a little overpowered.",VALORANT,The agent who's actually broken...

The fact of the matter is that yes, Raze's and Killjoy's abilities do kill. But you're so upset that you're only looking at one sentence of the tweet. If you collected yourself for one second, you'd read the rest of the tweet. ""Characters have abilities that *augment* their gunplay instead of fighting directly with their abilities.""

And that's exactly correct. Raze's abilities *augment* her gunplay instead of fighting directly. Any good Raze player will not run directly at you with her abilities out. You cannot directly fight an entire team 25 full rounds with just her abilities. (Mostly) \[for you devil's advocates out there\]

Now can you play an entire match using only Raze's abilities and 0 guns. Sure. Are you going to win or even get many kills? Probably not. Your team would say you're throwing and get upset at you.

If you're this upset at Raze and Killjoy while we're at it why not just complain about Molotov, Hot Hands, and Snake Bite since they can kill too. Do you see how ridiculous that sounds?

This doesn't even mention that there's literally 0 Agent imbalance in the game because BOTH teams can have the exact same Agents. Now I do believe all Agents should be balanced, and imo Riot has done an amazing job of that, compared to any other multi-character shooter I've ever seen**. I see no reason to continuously rail Riot for something they haven't even done wrong.**

Stop complaining about an Agent that hasn't even been released yet. You're not pointing out any issues because there are no issues. **All you're going to do is make Riot employees more scared to post anything on Twitter that might be taken the wrong way.** Which is not what we want. We want open communication both ways.",VALORANT,Stop Railing Riot for Killjoy

&amp;#x200B;

I dont understand. So basically, if theres 1 troll on your team, if you dont want to play with that person youre just shit outta luck because YOU get punished for leaving a game where your team doesnt want to win. Seriously? I just got held hostage in COMP , because 2 people just didnt want to play to win the game. On offense they would rush to the spike before anyone else, and hold it, forever and not plant. The only way to win was to kill all people, but once they realized that we werent planting, they were just hiding, so unless we were winning our game of hide and seek we were just losing rounds :)  On defense they didnt even bother to hold a site obviously, actually they were legitimately communicating with the enemy team throughout the entire game, and im sure if there were dancing emotes they wouldve just been dancing with the enemy, instead they were just tbagging eachother unless anyone that wasnt trolling showed up, then they would attempt to kill them. Even IF we won that game, which was close like 9-12 or something, it doesnt even matter. I honestly just didnt want to play with people who dont wanna play the game lmao. Why am I FORCED to play out this game or get penalized in situations like this? Literally just put in /votekick or if thats too difficult, maybe make it majority rules on a Forfeit??? Why the fuck, can ONE person out of 5, stop a forfeit vote?

1939,90CaliberNet,1595988927,hzs6vr,2,1,"Killjoy takes away all the points of valorant that makes up its identity with her turrets. Raze was already walking a pretty thin line but Killjoy puts a really bad look on the future of the game. I dont see a world where the game goes into a direction that does not require a shield champ and I think having a shield champ would defeat the purpose of this game. Considering Riot made it clear the game was gun play focus and the abilities were not suppose to be purely damage, if the turret is suppose to be weak and used for a distraction or as intel why make its only function to shoot people for you. Just because we can manipulate its function to be more than just an aimbot turret, doesnt mean it isnt at its core a bot with a gun that takes away the main focus of gun play.. In what world does a turret whose main objective is to shoot people a fundamentally ok thing to have in the game.",VALORANT,If Riot continue down this route of champ design with Killjoy I think Valorant will die

As it stands right now, anyone who wants to play Killjoy on Day 1 has to spend money. I don't even think it's possible to grind out the 300'000 XP within the first day or even two.

Most likely this won't change, and the smartest thing to do would be to quickly grind the weeklies, make it to Contract Lv 3-4 and use VP for the remaining levels (400-600 VP).

I could see this being an issue for new players in the future with an overwhelming amount of agents to not only learn, but also learn to counter during matches.

Maybe the developers will implement a ban system like in rainbow six siege before picking your agents. They could also possibly rotate agents in and out of competitive play.

2102,Odin_Gaming,1596205588,i18f37,3,2,"Dear Riot,

Ive been looking around YouTube, Twitter and Reddit about Valorant and something that I'm always seeing is that people want more maps and less agents. And to be honest, I totally agree. Let's start with more agents, if riot continues with their word and make 1 agent every 2 months (6 agents a year) the game will become another Overwatch. There would be every ability you could think about, the game would lose itself inside the amount of agents. I would personally half that with 3 or maybe even 2 agents a year. This would keep the game fresh but at the same time give each agent time to be balanced, find its place in the meta, be understood by the players etc. Another thing that would be a side effect of less agents are less bugs and better performance because riot would be spending less time on adding things and more time on fixing things.

Now to maps. The maps in Valorant have alot of work to be done, if I want to peak a angle I don't want to be shot in the back by someone holding another angle. I do know there are reasons for this but Ascent is in my opinion, a almost perfect map for Valorant, there ain't to many angles to peak and hide in, its clean, not many angles are awkward to hold and its got long range places has well has short range places. I'm not sure how many maps riot are thinking of putting into Valorant but I do hope that it is a few, maybe once again 2 or 3 a year and maybe if a map isn't liked give it a re-skin or re-design. 

In conclusion, add more maps and less agents. (And a profile feature) Thanks :)",VALORANT,Dear Riot.

Even more ridiculous that we voted to continue after 13-13 after failing our attack again.

3 people had no voice, team wasn't on the same page for attack. I had 3 kills at the end of round 13. Everyone kinda irritated with everyone.

Then I get a couple of kills in 16 and a couple more in 17 and get my confidence back and play like normal again (average 1 kill per round after round 13), Brim starts popping off hard in 18 19 and 20, enemy avoid A completely and everyone is important in every round, playing really well as a team on defence, and we finally got our shit together for attack on the 2nd overtime.

On the last defence they rush A again. They forgot why they stopped going A in the first place. Brim is there alone. 0:07, 0:09, 0:10 Op kills on A short from him. I only get to heaven by 0:15 to Op some one, but it felt kinda superflous, by the time the whole team is A, brim ults their last player. What a legend.

At 7-12 an enemy player said ""Why you putting off the inevitable?'"", I replied that I've had crazy come backs, and we're going to actually win this. And then we all started believing it.

Them: 2\*plat2 2\*plat1 1\*gold2 (the gold 2 was not weakest on their team)

Us: 2\*plat2 2\*gold3 1\*unranked.

I finished battlepass and I'm happy with .EXE skins for vandal and ghost, little bit less about Odin and Shotgun because I simply don't use this guns but those 3 white skins for Frenzy, Bulldog and Marshall are total trash IMO so I know I'm never gonna use them, and that's just me and my battlepass, there are people who bought some skins for Vandal or Phantom and then when Elderflame or Omni came out they bought them because they looks cooler so their old skins just collects dust in their inventory...

Player cards, I allready have about 10 maybe even more player cards and I don't need them, I need 4 or 5 favourite player cards which I can rotate between and the rest is useless...

Buddy's, game is just two months old and I allready have a buddy for every single weapon plus some unassigned ones which I'll never use because i have a better ones...

In a year, two years of time our invetories are gonna looks like junk full of trash unwanted items...

So my question is:

Anyone knows if Riots planning to implement some kind of exchange system in which you can sell your unwanted items for even a small amounts od radiant or valorant points?
I think they could make more money this way because not everyone is happy to spend £30-40 for a single skin they want but if we'll be able to sell unwanted items and get some points back from them and let say you got 1/3 or half of the money you need for your favourite skin from unwanted items you start to thinking ""ok I've got a bit allready so I can pay additional £15-20 to buy points to finally get the skin I want""

The gameplay can feel repetitive with the poor map rotation. For example, I will get 3 Ascents in a row then 2 splits in a row without seeing Bind or Haven the whole day. I think that the extra time to design we agents would be beneficial also, as they can focus more on differentiating the different agent's strengths and weaknesses. Anyways, let me know if you agree.",VALORANT,Does anyone else think that more maps are more important than more agents?

I want to state right away that I'm not sure if there is a better lineup for this, nor if this is even useful above my rank, but I have found in a lot of my matches on Ascent through these bottom ranks, someone is often holding that angle. Although not a powerful one on its own, it got me quite a few times in my last match, where for quite a few rounds, they had someone holding just to the left of the B main exit as well for a crossfire, and my team lost 1-2 people per round to that setup, so I wanted to find something to flush the defender out of there. 

I tried it in an unrated game after finding the lineup and it helped my team pick up a free kill on the fleeing defender, so I'll probably use it in the future. Feel free to tell me if it's useless though. :D",VALORANT,Brimstone molly for Market stairs cubby (Ascent B Site)

1) Matches where your team forfeits should not count towards ranked.
2) 20 matches to enter ranked is not nearly enough for a free to play game. Make it closer to what League of Legends has.
3) Set up a system that sorts people like Prime on CSGO does. Not necessarily saying make the same system. Just make a system that separates newly ranked accounts from established ranked accounts. So you have a playerpool that you will enter for your first X amount of hours of ranked. And after that amount of hours you can elect to play in the veteran player pool. Your rank would be the same between both pools but in the veteran pool you should be less likely to play a smurf bc of the rank progression earned in the lower pool. 

This isn't perfect, and I'm sure other people could add good ideas to it. But this would imo greatly enhance the experience in both ranked and unranked.",VALORANT,"Now that the game is a season in, they should up the ranked requirements."

As I see it each one serves a specific purpose. The Boom Bot is for scouting and potentially clearing angles and corridors, the Paint Shell is for pressuring opponents out of cover or into flankable positions, and the Blast Pack is for maneuvering. The Showstopper ult seems to serve no purpose other than to create a large, high damage explosion. The Boom bot is easy to avoid or destroy so if it kills, you that’s mostly your fault and if you destroy it, it has already served its purpose. The Blast Pack probably won’t damage you so it’s not a huge deal. My main issue is with the Paint Shell and the Showstopper. The Paint Shell is unstoppable and should be or else it’s purpose is defeated, but it should not be able to kill someone with full health and heavy shields, in fact it shouldn’t ever do enough damage to kill someone with full health or else it really is too powerful. The last thing is the ult, it’s way too powerful and can kill multiple people at full health/shields in a large area with no other tactical purpose.

2476,pofield,1596445849,i2tt54,10,1,"Hi,

I'm plat2 rn (started on gold1, rank up to dia1, but lost some games in the past scince I try solo queue more often) and wanted to share my (very long) opinion on why MM currently sucks.

Here are two things I hate the most:

- lack of communication:
Only 20% of the games 1-2 players are making callouts. 80% of the games it is just me talking and giving Info to myself through voice chat. Sometimes they still flame and tell you what to do using voice chat but giving info: naaah xd how about reporting them so they can give less Info because of mute xD

- misunderstanding of their role: 
In 90% of my games people dont know what role they are playing. Pheonix should entry with flashes, nope he holds angle. This is what 80% of the players do on attacker side: holding angles, get stucked somewhere or my favourite player who is lurking as reyna/raze/omen on the other side of the map not getting intel but just starring at a wall waiting for us to die so he can start moving to the other bomb site.

My opinion why these issues are there in the first place:

- lack of communication: 
In EU there are ltrly servers with voice disabled! So in ~10-15% of my games I have the privileged to play on those servers. ( Why...?? )
Also there is no reward for being a communicative and helpful teammate. Sooo why should anyone give info who dont understand that valorant is a team-based tactic shooter? Also there is this: ""i need my silence to lurk around the map"" mentality which is due how the game is designed. (Yes it is designed that way because it is hard to keep a momentum and most times anyone who approaches a site will die first and all the momentum is gone in 70% of the time) 

- misunderstanding of roles: 
Players who never dived deep into cs go or something comparable cannot know that there are certain roles in a tactic shooter. Valorant forces players to assign themselves a role at the beginning but NEVER tell them what there actual role is. 
It says duelist but u can take duels by holding angles too! 

Players who take duelist and not entry have done nothing wrong from the game's point of view. They are rewarded the same or even better than a poor brim or sage who have to enter a site and die... 

Also its fuking scary for a duelist to go first. Why? 
There are traps, slow orbs, smokes, mollies and enemies waiting for you around the corner. 
Ofc they are all counterable but when it comes to a push you have to kill the trap or walk through a smoke in 80% of the time and you will die in 50% of the time or even worse aaannnd thats where the game punishes you for being a noob who dies without a kill and you end up being last place although you are doing what you are fk supposed to do!! 

Another point is that there are so many things that slows you down but not enough things to keep the momentum. 
In csgo you decide to entry a side and ct throw a molly, you can counter it with a smoke. They smoke you off, you can counter it with a flashbang. There are always options to keep your momentum! 
In Valorant you waste 2 smokes at the start of an entry. Than you walk into a cypher trap and loose momentum ( i have never seen a team mate destroying a trap for me ), walk into a slow orb and loose momentum (dont even think about a sage wall), walk into smoke and loose team momentum cause in most cases you team will not follow you even if you flash out. In cs go it is your TEAM who flashes for the entry fragger and than follows him. It works because the big balls entry fragger can go out (and flash himself too) while the others follow him scince they threw a flash and are somehow commited to this site. An entry fragger in Valorant has to deal with flashing and clearing corners alone... No wonder players are scared to entry.
Valorant is clearly forcing players to play as a team and play a role,  trade kills but they dont reward it. In cs go you dont need these rewards cause everyone can play any role during a match. 

How I think these issues can be addressed: 

- lack of communication: 
Rate your teammate after game in a way that is transparent and rewarding: 
Maybe give them a skin/badge at the end of an act. 
Punish the toxic or non communicative players by queueing them together. 

Remove that stupid mute punishment for misusing voice chat. Who ever came up with this idea...

- misunderstanding of roles: 
Write a little more about what role the agent should take. Raze is not played the same as pheonix but yes they are both duelist! Make it somehow clear that certain agents have a certain purpose... Raze for aoe control and deny. Pheonix for searching first engagements and soo on. 

Reward teamplay more. Like entry on a site where bomb gets planted should give as much econ as 3 kills. Or trading should give more econ, smoking off angles should give econ and so on. plenty ideas how to reward good plays.
Punish those lurkers and baiters with wrong role more by not ranking after kills in scoreboard but after econ rating. So everytime they press tab they are last place not 1st or 2nd. Make them loose rank faster while players who play there role correctly can uprank faster or at least hold a rank longer.
Ofc there are designated lurker agents which will receive a reward for lurking.


That's it from me. pls  Make this game better for the majority of players in g1 - dia1 @riotgames.

(I'm the blue)

You know what I agree. I want more maps too. But you do realize the real problem with saying it like this is? **This is how we got here in the first place.**

Consumers want more and more and more and more and more, and ""oh woe is me I'm so bored in quarantine give me a game Riot"" so Riot responds by putting out a competitive game earlier than it needed to be.

Stop asking for more and more and more and more. If you keep demanding more maps, that's exactly what they'll give you. More unfinished work. **Stop being so impatient and let them do their jobs for once.**

But back to my point in the image. Have you played a Blizzard game? You pay for every expansion in WoW IN ADDITION TO YOUR MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. Overwatch was NOT a free game. And they weren't making money off new skins and maps so they revealed ""Overwatch 2"" (Garbage btw). Even their card game Hearthstone is a pay-to-win model, with the free-to-play players getting virtually shafted every expansion unless you had 10 hours of gameplay every day since Beta and used your gold/dust properly.

If you reach a rank but never win a game in that rank, it's as if you never reached that rank at all on your profile.

Personally, I think the moment of promotion should be the biggest, most hype moment of playing competitive and trying to achieve a higher rank; that's the moment where I feel my work has paid off, and where people will congratulate you on your progress, NOT your first or 9th win in that new rank.

I always go full abilities + Classic + no armour on pistol rounds, no matter whom im playing. While the Classic isn't as good as the Ghost at longer ranges, I dont think the Ghost is worth more than half of my available money.

For my second round, I always replenish my abilities if used in the first round + Ghost, usually one I picked up if I survive the pistol round, if im lucky a sheriff + light armour, since I'd expect the opponents to be using ""low-powered"" weapons.

I replenish my abilties every single round. For every subsequent round I use heavy armpur and whatever weapon I pick up if I survive the second round. If I don't survive, I generally follow these guidelines: Ghost if I have &lt;2.5k; Bucky if I have 2.5-4k; Vandal if I have &gt;4k. I never go for the Spectre as many people do when they can't afford a Vandal/Phantom. If I'm playing Viper and I decide beforehand that I want to ult, I take a Bucky. 

I generally dislike going below 1k except for final rounds and overtime, or if I buy for others. Of course, I do break the guidelines sometimes if im feeling confident for the next round, and spend my remaining 3k on a Vandal. I never go for Ops or Odins, just because I dont really fancy them.",VALORANT,How do you guys control your cash?

The only exceptions to this are Breach and Brimstone, who have other muted tones on their clothes. However, KJ is a disaster. She has green and yellow with purple accents in two shades, and her abilities have barely any resemblance to her. 

Her yellow jacket also looks weirdly bulky and IMO feels like it could turn into a super sized Cypher hat or Sage ponytail. On the agent select screen it doesn't look too bad but in game it looks twice as bulky. I can understand Riot trying to base her around a nerdy sort of hacker, but I don't see why she can't look like a sleek sort of spy rather than a four year old who dressed themselves. In her  smaller agent profile in loading screens and the top bar during games, the details are even more overwhelming due to the smaller scale. Her bangs. hat, and glasses combined with her brighter colours and highlights and different facial expression compared to the rest of the agents make her stick out like a sore thumb. Her hair also feels really off and physics defying as it is very stiff rather than more fluid like.

Aside from her character design itself, her abilities feel even more horrendous as they add even more bright, flashy colours. The other abilities are relatively colourful, such as Sage walls, Viper toxin or Reyna flashes, but they are centered around that agents colour or shade and are far less vibrant and saturated. KJ's abilities match with the Glitchpop skins better than they do to KJ.

2610,faceplant911,1596670415,i4ghl5,5,1,"If dev's are going around looking for feedback on the beta mode, hopefully they'll find this useful?

On health pickups:  
My assumption on the developer's intent for this mechanic is to encourage players to navigate the space, particularly with deadly long range weapons that would otherwise be more powerful sitting in a corner. In this sense, I think the pickups are a very successful mechanic and I've caught out multiple people (and been caught out by multiple people) going for heals. However, I find it hard to tell when a pickup is going to run out with the current shrinking icon, and I don't think it was the developer's intent to make the pickups ambiguous. I think that some other visual indicator should be used for how long the pickup will last, for example having the cross symbol empty like a battery icon.

On radar pinging:  
I'm pretty sure the developer intent of these pings was to make it easier to deal with campers. However, I think that this mechanic fails in this regard because the campers have access to just as much information as I do, and don't need to focus on moving while utilizing it. On top of that, the fact that I feel like I need to constantly use my map to deal with hyper-aware campers along with the fact that it's pretty much always more valuable to look at it than my actual crosshair, means that I've quickly started using it as my primary method of navigation. I'm 100% certain this is *not* what the developers intended, and it's annoying to me because it means I'm not practicing the crosshair placement and information gathering skills that I'm crucially lacking. My suggestion to change this is to change the UAV to be based on absolute distance from the last place you had a UAV ping (to prevent walking back and forth for campers), and to make it so if you're moving quickly it happens more like every 10 seconds so that it's not viable to rely purely on the minimap as a means of ""seeing.""

On post-death damage summaries:  
When I die and I look at my damage summaries, I often see something that's obviously completely different from what happened, like me dealing 250 damage to someone when I hit nothing, or me dealing nothing when I saw and heard hit indicators. After a while I realized the problem was that if someone other than the person I was fighting killed me, the game prioritized showing my fight results with the most recent ""foe"" over the person I was shooting. To be honest, I'm not interested in knowing that some random person killstole me for 30 damage to the chest, I care about the distribution of hits I had against the person I was shooting. It'd be great if the game could make its best guess on who I was actually fighting at the time of death, and give me the damage summary for that person as the first thing on the list.

On player count:  
I think the player count is essentially fine, but sometimes I find myself spawning in a portion of the map that's completely empty and all nine other people are on the other side. I don't know how the game decides who spawns where, but I think it should be tuned to be slightly more likely to put me at lost close-ish to the majority of the players in the server, otherwise I don't get as much done. This is just an opinion though, I don't know what the developers intentions were for respawning.

On random agents:  
I strongly dislike this decision. I spend a majority of my time playing with just two agents in standard games, and I've become used to the look and sound of those agents to the point where using someone else actually heavily distracts me. The hands look wrong, the voices sound wrong, even the simple knowledge in the back of my head that I'm not playing one of the characters I'm comfortable with throws me off, despite the fact that there's no abilities. If I want to play with agents I'm not used to for the purposes of learning them or something, I'd rather do it in actual games, or spike rush, or somewhere that isn't in Deathmatch. It's not like there aren't frequently three people on the same agent anyways, so I don't see the point of randomizing the agent. That being said, I'm aware that allowing people to choose agents could slow the rate of play since people might sit around forever picking an agent. Therefore I think you should either have to pick very quickly to get a desired agent (or else it'll be random) or you should have to select your preferred agents outside of the game so it's not part of the queuing process at all.

Hopefully y'all at riot find that helpful, and good luck as you iterate on this new mode!",VALORANT,DM Feedback from someone terrible at gunplay and in serious need of improvement.

I feel like the system works very well for draws IF you have all 5 players on your team, otherwise it's fundamentally flawed because the other team has all the control over the situation AND the 5 person advantage so of course they're gonna vote to continue because it screws you over while they get a (basically) free win even if the other team was better.

Solution: Personally I'm not sure because it's hard to keep it fair for both teams in a situation like this where one team has the advantage but should still get a fair vote.

2625,beepboopdata,1596663244,i4edyu,12,1,"Preface: I'm very glad that deathmatch has been added to the game and will be enjoying this much needed practice tool. As someone who does not have much time to play any more, DM offers a way to practice in context aim quickly and efficiently, something that I've been lacking. 

That being said... I don't agree with the heatmap / location indicators on the minimap. Although they are spaced out enough so that players do not know exactly where other players are, knowing the general area allows players to hold a specific area while knowing when to preaim an angle. Adding to this is how strong Operators are at holding angles (not that awping is inherently bad in DM, though some dislike it...), deathmatch ends up doing the opposite of warming up by encouraging players to either play defensively, knowing exactly where an opponent will peek, or forcing players to try and prefire people who are camping an angle (which doesn't help practicing aim or warming up).

CS:GO DM servers usually disable the minimap, and provide spawn invincibility until the player moves. I've noticed that occasionally some players are invincible, but it is far from consistent (I'm not sure how this is coded, maybe just for DC'd players?). Not that CS:GO's community DM servers are the only solution, but right now deathmatch does not feel thought out for what most players are looking for in a warmup / practice tool, let alone to play as a casual gamemode (I mean who really likes jumping in FFA DM only to end up in awp angle holding / prefire simulator)",VALORANT,Deathmatch Heatmap: Why it is not beneficial to warmup / practice

I don't have an xbox (and don't want one). I have a XPS 15 with a gtx 1050, which is good to play valorant one. But, its powerful enough for COD and other AAA games. Also, sure COD is way different than the kind of FPS valorant is where gun play is so much more skilful. So I think it will be great to add the gun mechanics of Valorant with arcade style game modes. If Valorant added these games, I would be in love.",VALORANT,What do you guys think about adding COD style modes to Valorant?

Whatever the game mode, roughly the average is 100XP per minute (To put it simply, usually 3000XP for a 30 minute game, 1000XP for a 10 minute game in Spike Rush: this is just ONE example, don't judge me! THANKS).

The problem is that if you cannot complete the missions in the deathmatch, it would be wise to give a number of experience points according to the number of victims. 

I'm thinking of 50XP, 25XP, or 20XP per kill, so the winner gets 1500XP or 750XP or 600XP.

You dont get to get any progress from your missions and you don't get any reward in special for standing out in the deathmatch you just played. It is really bad that it doesn't reward you with anything really. Playing a deathmatch and get in 1st place, gets you the same exp as if you win 2 rounds in unrated or finish half of a spike rush.

I know the argument could be ""Oh but it's for new players or to practice aim"", that could be a good point if the practice range and tutorial didn't exist.

2807,sssoft_and_sssubtle,1596819054,i5hcq9,0,1,"I have to be honest here, the weapon mechanics are very discouraging. I find myself quite annoyed every time I die in this game, not because of why it happened, but **how**. I'm not a perfect player, I make mistakes, a lot of them, not ashamed to admit it, but why is something as stupid as running and shooting so rewarded with such high accuracy? 

Deathmatch has proven the importance of pre-firing, why bother with learning how to counter-strafe around the corner while aiming at the headshot-level of all the positions, if you can just run out and shoot whatever you have with you at the moment and get the same or even more value out of it?

The weapon layout and behaviour in VALORANT is supposed to resemble the ones of CS:GO, I think that's clear. However, they don't behave the same as their CS counterparts at all, which was most likely not intended and screws up VALORANT's core mechanic: gun play.

I've made a little comparison on how the weapons behave between the games.

*Processing video 7wasjcgatlf51...*

There's one very important thing to note when watching the comparison. In VALORANT, the movement barely disrupts the spray pattern, they're pretty much the same but on a bigger scale, which makes them controllable, **while running**, which is stupid. (While running, bullets **nearly never** go below your crosshair.) In CS:GO, movement makes the spray patterns random, which is what makes it so discouraging to do there. There's no consistency to it, therefore it's not worth to do it.

I also have several concerns about counter-strafing in VALORANT, well.. rather the lack of its existence. Counter-strafing doesn't actually exist in this game, you get as much value from just letting the character to finish its movement on their own as from stopping the movement yourself.

*Processing video 185ox2aeylf51...*

As a CS veteran, having invested thousands of hours across the most memorable CS titles; 1.6, Source, GO, don't know a single game where accuracy matters and counter-strafe doesn't exist. For someone like me, this is not a case of ""just don't do it,"" **this is a tech that's been building up in my muscle memory for more than a decade.** Counter-strafing distinguishes good players from the bad ones. 

Due to the lack of its existence, this greatly hinders sniper players. Since counter-strafing doesn't exist in VALORANT, all it does is it only adds extra movement. That little piece of movement can **significantly** disrupt the accuracy of a sniper, as shown in the following video:

To explain, me and my friends arent great at the game il admit but last night we were playing on Ascent and we were up 9 to 3 going into the switch. We were now on offense and won the first round making the game 10 to 3. This is where everything went downhill. They win the next round, no biggie, next round starts. Almost pulled off this round but lost in a 1 on 1 with an op player, score now 10 to 4. From here on out 3 players on their team had ops every round. We did not have any smokes and no matter what we did to try to pick off the guys with ops we either couldnt or we would get the kill only to be killed by another op from a different angle. We were absolutely shut down for the rest of the game we ended up only winning one more round and losing the game 11 to 12.

What would your approach be to counter this situation? We tried so many different things but no matter what we did it ended with all of us getting oped.

For context out team comp was: Phoenix, Sova, Sage, Raze, and Killjoy.

2856,Colorful_Affection,1596791378,i5ajxk,0,1,"I usually don’t encounter them too often, but I think God decided to smite or something because damn, I got some pretty toxic players recently. One called me a gay slur, which was honestly super irritating because I am mostly attracted to dudes, another kept screaming and cussing into his microphone to get onto the site, and another was just flaming me in chat despite the fact that I was higher than him on the leaderboard. The same dude who called me a slur also breathed heavily into his microphone which definitely triggered some sort of anxiety in my friend, so I initiated a minor argument. Has anyone had a streak of unluckiness lately? I’ve been playing Valorant for quite a long time, and I feel like I should be a little used to this, but I cannot handle slurs or what happened to my friend. Of course, I mute them afterwards, but it’s just irritating that I encounter it in the first place. Also encountered a sexist guy on, but I think I’d explain too much for my own good if I told that story. 

Also, if you guys can *please* call out any racist, sexist, or overall unnecessarily aggressive behavior, it just ain’t cool. Don’t get too wrapped up in it though, it’s probably best not to give toxic people too much of a reaction.",VALORANT,Has anyone else had unlucky matchups with toxic players lately?
2857,Warrenx_Wallerx,1596785708,i59jto,10,1,"So before yesterday I had no clue an Xp farm was a thing in valorant. I hoped into a spike rush in which people were killing themselves using brimstone abilities (as, as you all know in spike rush all your abilities are already charged from round 1) and although they lose the game, the game gives you 1000 xp at a time. Quite frankly I see this method as inefficient as I've recently been grinding the game to get Killjoy and I've only managed to get half way through level 1 or two I belive. The Xp grind is super tough because you just have to get so much of it. Anwyays I doubt this will be the last time I see anything like this so I was wondering if and although it didn't annoy me, is the right thing to do just report them? If I report them do they get into trouble like does Riot record games to check when sombody has been reported for cheating? Or should I try not to be a Killjoy (get it cos the charecter lol ) and just let em carry on because I won't lie, if I didn't love the game so much and didn't love the rush of playing matches I'd probally do the same. And because I don't wanna get ban. Anwyays what should I do when I encounter Xp Farmers? Should I spoil their fun or just leave it seeing as its only just one Spike rush it isn't that deep.",VALORANT,What To Do When I Encounter Xp Farmers

Campers in DM: why is this a problem in Valorant but not in CSGO? Because of the large footstep radius, slow movement speed and the low TTK. None of these are going to change because they’re part of the core game play.

People camp in this game and hold angles, especially when there are no abilities to be used. I don’t get why people are complaining about how players are playing DM, because they’re playing how this game is supposed to be played.

3030,DrunkenInvader,1597013162,i6sx58,2,1,"The Hive-Mind weapons, and cards in the battle pass got me thinking what could they mean? I was think back to the 1st battle pass and remembered that 1,there was a group of weapons themed to a group(kingdom)  and agent (killjoy) who was related to the group and  had a card (vertraulich)hidden there as well.   So could it be that the Hive-Minds could be an agent or a game-mode?(i will get back to that later)  


Where this idea starts is at the epoch event card an epoch event as quoted from Wikipedia means "" The epoch moment or date is usually defined from a specific, clear event of change"" The event card depicts a spike explosion. Now this makes me think to real life and the story of aliens being attracted to  nuclear areas and when the Americans droped the nukes in japan was the epoch event of the nuclear age. So could the Hive-Minds be attracted to radiant bringing them to Earth?  


Now this is where it gets weird due to lack of things to theorize off of. how the Hive-Mind gets to earth is via a portal like the darkside beyond spray also know as the ""radiant portal"" on the official valorant discord server, now this might be a bit contrary to apart of above because the Hive-Mind player card is known as ""playercardExoAltUniverse""   


Now how this could be a game mode is a style of MvM where the hive-mind will come out of radiant portals and will try to steal more radiant from us, and we will have to defend it. Now remember this is a theory and  there were only a few things i could go over because trying to fit in the X011 experiment card just seemed too bizarre.(also side bit some players will say ""weapon skins are not cannon"" now in my opinion only the ones that come out on the store page are not cannon)  


So I will leave the rest of the theorizing up to you guys, could this be a MvM styled game mode or was this just a bored player theorizing about nothing while waiting for his friends to get on so he can get back to grinding for sliver? We might not know until the final days of the battle pass. But until then have fun theorizing!",VALORANT,Lore theory: the Hive-Mind cards and what they could be meaning?

Her first ability is cyphers cyber cage crossed with brimstones incendiary and both of them by themselves are annoying enough but merged to 1 nano swarm is on a new level all together not saying that she has 2 of them.

Second ability is trapwire on steroids when in range it goes up to them and explodes in there face causing them to be vulnerable and deals 5 damage.(That's insane Jarvis sorry i meant Wardell) This ability has countless possibilities.

Third ability This is a turret like thing so when in range it shoots target dealing 5 damage (Another insane Wardell).

3125,ProjectWHaT,1597024642,i6vz5n,0,1,"I've played a bunch of Valorant since the beta and have spent 2k+ hours in CSGO. Here are some of my personal thoughts on the current state of deathmatch.

Overall, I think it's a good game mode for a deathmatch. It's fun and pacing is fine. However, as a tool for warming up, I believe it is not good enough.

In CSGO, there is an official team deathmatch mode. Much like Valorant's deathmatch, it is time based, there's a delay between spawns, and there's a low amount of players in the server. For a casual game mode, especially for new players, this is definitely sufficient. 

But many players are looking for a tool to use for warming up and in this current state, it does not work well. In CSGO, there are custom community servers that have custom game modes, one of which is FFA, or free-for-all. In this deathmatch, there's usually the max amount of people allowed in the server with no pauses between spawns. It is absolutely hectic. You spawn and die immediately multiple times. You barely have time to think. And that's what's good about it. You focus on the aiming and nothing more.

My main issues with Valorant deathmatch as a tool for warming up:

* Pacing is too slow. 
   * The little pause between spawns is frustrating. I personally don't get frustrated playing CSGO FFA, because you're constantly in a battle. You barely have time to contemplate what just happened. In Valorant, in the seconds between, I think about how annoying the camper was or how poor my aim was. 
   * There's not enough people in the server. I'm constantly running around looking for enemies. In CSGO FFA, you spawn and there's someone almost immediately in front of you, or around the corner. You rarely have time to run around
   * The pacing of the warm up before the deathmatch is on the right track and reminds me of CSGO FFA. There's no wait time between spawns and it seems to be easier to spawn near enemies allowing for quick practice
* Short match time
   * When I warm up, I usually warm up for 20+ min. Having the constant down time between queuing and spawning is frustrating
* Minimap gives away too much
   * Sometimes, I'm just constantly staring at the minimap, because it's basically wall hacks. In a casual mode, it's okay, but for warming up, it's really not needed. I understand it's supposed to give away a camper's location, but I believe it's unneeded, especially when the points above are addressed. 
      * There's no need to camp in a warm up mode as that defeats the purpose of being in a mode to warm up. And if you kill a bunch of people, multiple people know your location and will hunt you down the next time they get to that part of the map. The camping isn't as frustrating when you can instantly respawn back in the action
* Health and magazine ammo
   * Picking up health is a neat idea and I understand it's supposed to encourage movement, but like the minimap, it's not necessary for warming up. When I kill someone across a site or a long hallway, it's frustrating that the health is so far away and that I'll likely be killed before I get there and thus need to wait to respawn, piling on the frustration 

Some possible solutions:

* Straight up copy FFA DM
   * The rules in FFA DM are the way it is, because they work as a tool for warming up
      * instant spawning so that you're constantly in the action
      * packed servers so there's constant action
      * infinite session time so you can practice for as long as you need to
      * no minimap since it's super easy to find enemies
      * health and magazine ammo refill on kill to allow for long streaks and not to punish those who are doing well (note: some servers only refill on headshots to incentivize better aim)
* Build off of ""warm up""
   * As I said, the ""warm up"" period before the start of the deathmatch is not too bad and can be used as a deathmatch
* Let there be community servers
   * This way users can decide on their own rules for a warm up mode. In addition it allows for the community to come up with new ideas which can lead to cool new features

I am not saying to scrap the current deathmatch, as I have said, it's a good casual mode, but for warming up, I believe a different mode is needed that covers all of the points made above.

I hope the devs and the community take these points in to consideration and I would love to hear everyone else's thoughts on the game mode",VALORANT,Thoughts On Deathmatch For Warming Up

Learning all these different utility combinations and locations for all the maps and sites and scenarios seemed pretty daunting, so I thought, ""I could make an app that made this really easy"".

I'm working on an app that lets you make and save ""plays"" (per agent instructions for coordinated action). Right now I just have the basics of a search screen made, but tomorrow I'm going to add a ""play"" viewer screen.

What you're seeing is a preview of a ""play"", showing when and where it is for, along with the agents required to execute it. (eventually, they will be searchable by which agents they need and much more, making it easy to use mid-round).

[This is the search screen so far \(displays short previews of the \\""plays\\""\), it's displaying demo data from static variables, but sometime soon I plan on making the data editable and saveable from a menu in the app.](https://preview.redd.it/tqxz3q3xs3g51.jpg?width=646&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5312b65283bc8b82edce59e7378d72062eea546a)

&amp;#x200B;

[This is my sketch for the expanded view of the \\""play\\"". It will show required utility\/guns along with instructions for your agent, and with images for clarity.](https://preview.redd.it/lgthv3d8t3g51.jpg?width=710&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2127fb3b954f8f2194a06f665f675bd2eca652e7)

**Planned Feature List:**

* Expanded ""play view""
* Only show selected agents instructions
* Edit/create plays
* Search by agents currently on your team
* Search by map, side, type, economy status, and rating
* Join a ""team"" lobby and synchronize plays
* If in a team, it auto chooses the agent for you
* Add saving or favoriting ""plays""
* Specify which utility needs to be bought for the selected agent

TL:DR: I suck at coordinating strategies and I am making an app that lets me do it easy and fast. So tell me if there is anything you think this app needs that isn't on the list!",VALORANT,"I've started work on my strategy organizer and sharing platform, what are some features you think it needs?"

The story for this final is incredible. Tsm was once crowned greatest NA team in valorant. Sentinels dethroned the king in the last two tournaments. Sentinels have to fight to defend their newly earned crown and Tsm wants their position as greatest in NA back. Tsm dropped sentinels 2-0 upper finals to knock them down to losers. Sentinels fought back, defeated immortals, and came back swinging. The rematch of century. Tsm starts off with a map up and first map, haven, was their choice. Sentinels didn’t back down and took their map. Tsm didn’t get scared and took split, a map where sentinels were known for their prowess. Then, ascent came. Tsm was known for revolutionizing the sageless comp in this map against t1. Every team adopted this format and sentinels mastered this map with sinatraa’s famous sova Odin plays. They did not disappoint and brought us to a fifth map. The game was neck and neck and eventually sentinels got a 4 in a row, with one round with a 0.03 second defuse, and was at match point. Tsm didn’t stop and dragged it to ot. Tensions were high and Tsm pulled it off, winning 6 rounds in a row to claim back their title as greatest. This match will go down as one of the greatest in this game.",VALORANT,Tsm vs Sentinels is the greatest match to date
