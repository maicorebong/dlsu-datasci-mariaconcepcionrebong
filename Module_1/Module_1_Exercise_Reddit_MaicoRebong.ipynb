       "   'selftext': \"Just some guy's dumb opinion but, I would personally love to see more maps than agents in this game. I'd much prefer have one new map per episode or act or whatever than an agent. Because I feel like with the current 11 we have right now, they all already have unique abilities and playstyles to keep people busy without craving for a new one, whereas the maps however, at least for me, I'm getting so fricking tired of playing in Haven for the fifth time in a row. Plus, me personally I am REALLY interested in the lore of this game would love to see more of the world. It's not a complaint, more of a suggestion. Thanks 4 readin\\n\\nP.S. I understand that creating maps is much more time consuming and challenging on the devs part, so to compensate, another solution would just be to let the community create maps and just pick the best one using like a contest or something and the winner gets to have a free dragon skin or something. Just a suggestion.\\n\\nP.P.S I'm not saying that there should only be new maps and no new agents or That maps are more important, a balance between both we'll do. we dont want an overwatch situation now do we\",\n",

For those who aren\\'t aware, I\\'ll some it up real quick. When you buy a skin set, you are only paying for the model and the opportunity to upgrade the effects. \\n\\nTo put this in other terms, let\\'s compare this to Riot\\'s other game \"League of Legends\". This is like if in League, when you buy a skin. You only pay for the Model and you have to buy the Visual Effects for your Q, W, E, R, and passive separately. It\\'s extremely scummy. If I buy your overpriced skin skin set, I should get all the effects; I shouldn\\'t have to spend more.',\n",

I bought the Oni set and the battle pass and have completed the entire battle pass and was STILL only able to upgrade 1 single weapon fully. This is just ridiculous.\\n\\nWe need to bug RIOT about this. If we are paying good money for skins why do we need to spend another $100-$300 just to full upgrade a full set of weapons. Just seems a bit ridiculous to me.\\n\\nDon't you guys think the prices for upgrading weapons are ridiculous?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hello guys,\\n\\nsince the current popular topic is that the recoil time is longer than it should be and it takes away certain skill by basically forcing you to pray and spray, I\\'ve noticed that there is other thing that takes skill and replaces it with RNG.\\n\\nIt is the first shot inaccuracy, which means that even though you have your crosshair centered on your opponents head, there is a chance that the shot will miss.\\n\\nI went to the practice range, sent the bot to 50 m, bought operator, centered the crosshair on his \"eye\" and then bought vandal. I had shooting bound to keyboard to prevent any unnecessary mouse movement and the result is that:\\n\\nOut of the 20 shots that I took with crosshair perfectly centered over the bots head, only 9 of them counted as headshot. That\\'s 45% accuracy.\\n\\nhttps://gfycat.com/deadbetterjaguar\\n\\nKeep in mind that this is with crosshair perfectly centered, so to chance to miss goes up if your aim is sllightly off. I can imagine that if you aim at the left third of the head hitbox, you will get even worse numbers.\\n\\nThis means that Riot decided that they want to equalize the playing field by replacing a portion of your skill with RNG. No matter how good your aim is, you might still not get the kill and on the other hand thanks to that the guy on the other side, despite not aiming at your head might actually headshot you.\\n\\nWhy does it bother me so much? Because the way Valorant presents itself is \"competitive shooter\" with \"competitive integrity\" as its focus. RNG has no place in any of these and it is my opinion that individual skill should be the deciding factor, not RNG.\\n\\nIt seems Valorant instead tries to blur the lines a bit to make the game more newbie friendly in order to maximize player base. And with the number of skins that are being pushed out, it feels like Valorant tries to be the next Fortnite rather than the next CSGO.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I have seen many discussions about this with the community mostly agreeing that accuracy/recoil reset time need to be lowered but still no changes.\\n\\nThe \\\\~1s recoil reset is just a braindead concept to me as a CSGO veteran now with a ton of valorant games behind me. Holding a site as 2 people is straight up impossible/RNG if they are 5 man rushing as transitioning from one target to another (if you shot multiple rounds) will just mean you have to wait a time during which they definetly kill you or have an aim like you are running.\\n\\nWhenever these technical arguments came up about the CSGO-Valorant mechanincs the arguments are that: Valorant doesn't have to be like CSGO, it's more accesable, team focused, less focused on god-like aim.\\n\\nNow what the high accuracy reset time creates doesn't even seem to stand up to these standards:\\n\\n\\\\-It is highly frustrating to see that you haven't shot for a time and your crosshair reseted position and everything, but your shots still go nowhere where you aim which is definetly a terrible new player experience, but even as a vetran FPS player\\n\\n\\\\-More frustration that you barely can kill more than 1-2 targets rushing making crossfires to be   \\nless effective and promoting brainless rushing\\n\\n\\\\-God-like aim actually becomes more prevelant, with tournaments being played now high level Valorant gameplay seems to revolve all around 1-tapping people as that barely effects your accuracy\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'First, some background: I am an ex CS player with over 1 hour on the game. I have seen Overwatch on twitch and installed Apex Legends for one week before getting bored. Overall lots of FPS experience.\\n\\nNow, here are the four main tips I kept in mind during my ranked progression\\n\\n1) The first thing you want to do is remove the V key from your keyboard. This is because talking in voice chat will distract your teammates and is a must-not. Instead, spam A, B, or C in the text chat whenever you see an opponent because the entire team is pushing you.\\n\\n2) Agent selection: The most important part of this game is getting kills. Therefore you must always pick Jett, Raze, or Reyna. Practice selecting and locking in your agent in spike rush to make sure you always get who you want. A second tip is to press caps lock during agent selection and type \"SAGE PLS SAGE PLS\" in chat in order to guarantee a well rounded team. (Everyone needs a healer)\\n\\n3) Crosshair placement: I have noticed repeatedly that in high ranks, like silver 1 and 2, player often make the mistake of aiming for the head, forgetting about recoil. Recoil is a feature that makes your bullets go up. To counter this, look directly at the floor at all times so that in any engagement your shots will hit the opponents head as recoil occurs.\\n\\n4) Econ: many new player often make the mistake of buying guns like the phantom. vandal, and operator, along with their abilities. When purchasing these things, players forget that dying will mean they can only buy a pistol. To avoid this, get an stinger, ares, or marshall every round so that you will never need to use bad guns. Abilities aren\\'t important, so don\\'t buy and save cash. If you\\'re feeling extra wealthy, try grapping a frenzy or a shorty to supplement your loadout. \\n\\nHope this helps everyone! Good luck out there!',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I realized today, seeing how little xp this week's set of weekly missions give, that most people will never reach level 50 without grinding the game. I assume the last set of weekly missions will give around the same amount of xp, maybe 1k more each. It doesn't really make a difference.\\n\\nThis is the first time I play a game I like with a battlepass system. I thought playing a couple games every day would be more than enough to complete the thing. Oh boy I was wrong.\\n\\nIf you don't play 2 to 3 games a day, **every single day** of the battlepass' length, you won't make it to level 50. Period.\\n\\nHad a long day at work and you want to rest a bit instead of playing? Nope.\\n\\nWant to spend a week-end with your family and friends? Nope.\\n\\nThis is very anti-consumer practice and I don't think it should be the norm. I consider myself lucky because the day the battlepass launched, I noticed there was absolutely no benefit of buying it early on so I didn't buy it yet. But a lot of people did and most of them will fall short of level 50 and will have to make a choice. A tough choice. Give up on the last rewards or spend a little extra VP on the battlepass.\\n\\nThis has been thoroughly calculated and designed by Riot Games for it to end like this. **They are not your friends**, they are trying to squeeze every bit of money they can by playing with your brain. Don't fall for it.\\n\\nMy hope is that for the next battlepass, either Riot Games realize their battlepass model is grindy, and do something about it (which I never expect from them) or that way more people speak with their wallet and don't buy the next battlepass. That will teach them.\\n\\nJust my thoughts, thanks for reading, sorry for broken english not native.\",\n",

I thought the Overtime changes put in recently were gonna be great and a better, fairer reflection of the performance in the game. However, playing a game recently it went overtime and it was a slog with both teams doing well. We got to 15-15 and the game immediately ended as each time both teams win a round in an overtime bracket it goes to a vote to draw and the more overtime rounds played the fewer and fewer votes are needed to end the match in a draw. So ultimately at 15-15 it needs one person to press draw to end the game. The entire lobby (apart from one guy apparently) were on board that we had got this far, it was a tense encounter with my team communication and teamwork (not premade) being really solid and on point. The way the game ended like that with no reward to either side felt awful and unenjoyable. \\n\\nIn my opinion the game should continue until it's concluded especially if the vast majority of the lobby feel the same and shouldn't be forced to end after multiple overtimes as they only add to the pressure and intensity leading to a more enjoyable experience.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"There has been a ton of discussion on this sub pertaining to the high prices of skins in the shop. Contrary to many opinions, I can roughly understand why gun skins are priced how they are. However, what I find difficult in this situation is the pressure placed on the buyer to get a bundle over an individual gun skin. Sure, bundles should always provide perks to incentivize their purchase, but in Valorant bundles, the price difference is so extreme so as to make me feel bad if I don't get the bundle.\\n\\n In the case of elderflame, it is shown in the shop as being around $61 cheaper than purchasing the skins individually, thus, if only getting one or two items, there's a sense that you 'might as well' get the bundle. At smaller price points, this is no biggie, but at these higher price tiers this means individuals may be pressured to spend $10, $20, $40 more than they're comfortable with if they like these skins.\\n\\n If the difference between individual and bundle pricing were less severe, this wouldn't be as much of an issue\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Been grinding this since the release date and I have some ideas and other ideas are from this subreddit and I just thought it would be nice to point them outhere. \\n\\n/ on your hud it should show which kind of skins of the gun you have instead of just saying vandal even though you own a skin ([https://imgur.com/NdmdmQC](https://imgur.com/NdmdmQC))\\n\\n/ on by menu it should display your skin that you own instead of default one ([https://imgur.com/yflxVVS](https://imgur.com/yflxVVS))\\n\\n/ display skin tiers on collection cause basically once you buy skins on the store it has no meaning and you have no idea what kind of tier they belong to and it basically makes no sense even to have those tiers if once you buy them it doesn't show up anymore ([https://imgur.com/DnnebCs](https://imgur.com/DnnebCs))\\n\\n/ make skin collections per agents happen and let people modify their loadouts per different agent (for example you have five vandal skins and you wan't to have them all in game so you have one for Viper, one for Reyna and etc)\\n\\n/ it's kinda unfair that after every game you get experience only for playing rounds and winning them so basically if you are winning hard you kinda should lose some rounds in order to get more experience points for battlepass this shouldn't be a thing or there should be one more criteria like performance (for example if you are match or team mvp you would get some sort of experience boost like maximum up to 1000) and other players would get experience not for KDA and etc because it would be unfair support player wise but for their role on the team (for example sage would get experience points for healing, ultimate, slows and so on) duelists would get their experience boosts from first bloods, kills, clutches and etc. this would kinda solve the battlepass grind problem and you would be more focused on your role in order to get the additional experience points.\\n\\n/ i have an additional idea for battlepass. as we all know grinding battlepass is kinda annoying and has a very dry feel but maybe new feature like as you buy the battlepass on every act it would say get kills with weapon let's say on the act II it would say: get kills with ghost (0 / 1000) (the amount can change with gun usage and etc for example bucky or odin would have much less kills needed to reach the goal than vandal or phantom) when you reach the goal you would gain additional skin for the task that you completed. in my opinion this would push people to play this game even more and they would be awarded for playing the game and paying money for battlepass.\\n\\nthanks for the long read and i would love to hear people opinions about the things that i just wrote out!\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'A small rant about things I don’t agree with/should be in the game.\\n\\nFirst of all, moving accuracy is ridiculous.  You shouldn’t be able to swing around a corner at full speed and be able to headshot someone over 15 feet/4.6 meters away from you.  The amount of times I have killed or been killed by somebody running is ridiculous.  It feels like I am playing Overwatch, especially in unrated.\\n\\nSecond, Split and ascent feel way too defender sided.  Having two chokepoints to get onto site, or having to push a basic no man’s land(mid), which defenders can stop by utility dumping on areas the attackers need to push to be able to get to a point where they can take site.  If the attackers use their own utility it ends up leaving the attackers with little utility left to actually take site, or little to actually defend site with.\\n\\nThird, the competitive algorithm seems to benefit duelists more than support agents, which in turn causes less people to play them and more people to play duelists.  The algorithm could count enemies blocked by smoke as ‘points’, enemies tagged/revealed as ‘points’, or enemies slowed as ‘points’ to help a player’s score in the match go up and help increase their rank. \\n\\nFourth, it would be great to be able to unselect an agent.  Sometimes confusion in the agent selection screen cause there to be no sage, too many duelists, or no smoke agents.\\n\\nFifth, viper and breach are hilariously underpowered with pick rates insanely low.  Something simple as viper being able to pick up her wall or breach having an extra flash could boost viability and pick rates for those agents.\\n\\nSixth, and honestly the least, the battle pass has turned into a chore.  Daily missions do not give you enough bonus xp so it feels like you have to play a ton of matches to level up in the pass.  Sometimes it just isn’t enjoyable to grind some of the weekly missions either.  Stuff like ult 50 times is so redundant and requires too many matches.\\n\\nI am Gold 2 currently and these seem to be some problems plaguing gameplay.  I do not have a real main as I play anyone, but Jett is the most enjoyable for me.  I would love to hear y’alls opinions but am posting this before bed so I will get to you in the mornings.',\n",

I had to clutch multiple rounds with aces and quadra kills, I was having an insane game, my aim was on point (it’s usually terribly average) and my plays were going great. But at the end of the game, after all that hard work I only gain ONE green arrow up...so I just don’t get how the mmr gain works in this game. I know the amount of rounds you won compared to the other team matters, but they say so does individual performance, so why only ONE green arrow up is what I’m asking. Thanks! :)',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I am genuinely lost in how rating is scored in Valorant. There is an abundance of information that to help you determine where you land. (MVP titles, Overall KDA, Econ, over score rating and W/L variance (close or not close games), that little arrow system that doesn't seem to account for shit) Reading the patch notes gave information on how its supposed to work, but just seems either very one side or extremely diverse in a way where the information you get post games means jack shit.\\n\\nI have had two experiences where my overall score average would be higher across a set of 5 ranked games (same amount that determines your placement rank). On both occasions he average 3 wins I had would be 13-9 or 13-10 and my two loses would be 13-7.13-9. Both times id get 3 up arrows and one 2 arros. the loses are one arrow down and derank. Ill even get team MVP during a loss. If i calculate my score rating between 5 games to find my average, it doesn't seem to reflect when i get ranked or even deranked. I have literally ranked up after getting stomped in a game where I got carried and went from gold 1 to gold 2. \\n\\nOutside of just getting good and shooting people in the face, can anyone shine some light on how the fuck riot decides where you belong in its comp system? \\n\\nI don't care where I place, I just really enjoy playing the game. I could be silver for all I care. I just want to know how to interpret the information I am given because its not clear at all on how it effects you\",\n",

Two being the worst, my game mid ranked match round dropped to 3 fps....For no reason, nothing I could see. It only fixed itself and jumped back to 150fps after I died and the round was over. I don't think its my computer, so I would chalk it up to some background optimization issues with the patch/graphics in game. Or that vgc is acting up/consuming too many resources. I have caught it before at the main menu at 20% cpu usage. Anyone else experiencing this? I have seen some fps issue posts but not any with the drop like I experienced.

I suggest players before the game be able to choose a smoke or a flash.

In CSGO a team wouldn’t dare run more than 2 AWPs at once, but in Valorant a defensive team with 3-4 OPs means they are in a great position. \\n\\nIn CSGO de_train is the most CT sided map and an AWPer’s paradise because of the long distances and narrow lanes. De_train is also the most disliked map amongst puggers because of the synergy that’s needed for T side. Every map in Valorant basically feels like de_train, especially Ascent. \\n\\nI think I need a break from this game until the meta changes. Having 3+ OPs on defense should be risky and not a strong setup. However, the slow pace of the game and the sight lines makes OPs very strong.\\n\\nTo compensate, I think the OP needs a much longer delay to shoot between each shot. As of now you can’t trade kill an OPer. Players move too slowly to close the distance. There needs to be time for an attacking team to trade the OPer and increasing the time between shots will help.',\n",

You can’t advertise a $100 bundle as these animated insanely cool dragons for people to find out they have to pay more money in some way to unlock those styles.  Someone already calculated that it would be $250+ to unlock the dragon bundle completely without the battle pass of course.\\n\\nSolution 1:  \\n\\nMake skins more valuable by including all tiers/cosmetic variations in the current price.  This will justify the price for a lot of players including myself.\\n\\nSolution 2:  \\n\\nHave a system that rewards RP for every win/loss.  2 RP per win and 1 RP per loss.  Spike rush obviously not included.  This means that someone would have to win 5 games to unlock 1 basic tier (roughly 3 hours of gameplay).\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nI feel as if the community would agree that Solution 2 is best for both parties.  Players can either choose to grind roughly 25 hours in straight wins to upgrade one of their Elderflame skins all the way or they can choose to purchase RP in the store.  I’m curious, let me know what you think about the current RP system.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"This isn't as much of a problem on riots side as much as it is mine, was looking to find some tips and ideas from others. It's crazy to me how much my skill in a game can differ. I'll play one game top fragging, going 25-35 kills in a game with 10-15 deaths and then the next game I'll be at the bottom usually 5-10 kills with 15-20 deaths. I just really don't understand it because it's not just because of the enemies I'm playing, it's like all my skill goes away. My aim is slightly off, I can't flick, I position badly, it all just goes away. Could this be because of too long of breaks in between games (I usually take 5min to get into another game), or because I'm just overthinking? A lot of the time I find myself just tripping into a road of retrogression and then I have to take my time to relearn a skill in that day to actually have fun playing the game. Anyways, thanks for looking at this post since I've been struggling with this a lot recently!\",\n",

I have no issues with it except in Valorant. In Valorant, on wired mode on the headset, my sound is loud per usual, like my old headset. However, on wireless mode with the new headset, the sound is lower. I ran a decibel meter while playing to test and it was true; Valorant volume was lower on wireless mode. I thought it was a headset issue, but I tested in Discord, Spotify, and even CSGO and Valorant was the only app which lowered the sound on wireless mode.\\n\\nI checked the Windows 10 volume mixer and Valorant was always at 100%.\\n\\nI was thinking that perhaps something in Valorant could be interfering with something, perhaps iCUE or the USB dongle I am using for the headset on wireless mode. \\n\\nIf you have any suggestions or a fix, please let me know!\",\n",

It feels so stupid for me that i wonder if this can change in further updates. Why ban a player who leaves a match because of system issues if he comes back in order to complete that match. And i'm not talking about the last rounds of the match. I came back right before it was the half of it. And believe me. I was absent for like 10 mins and still got banned for 40 for leaving the game. Logic beats this system....\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I’ve been playing valorant since the beta and probably like the most of you. I have never encountered a cheater ONCE in the beta at all. Ever since this game has been released I have encountered numerous ESPR’s and aimbotters throughout my games. I’ve hovered around the Diamond 1 to Diamond 3 range for the past month now and I’ve never seen these much hackers in a game until now. You may be thinking, “oh he’s just worse then the other players and is accusing them of hacking.” No, I’ve reported these people and have received updates saying that they have been banned numerous times...for numerous hackers. That’s nice that they received a ban but what about my rank? Do I get some elo back? Hello? I do not understand how you install a rootkit into everyone’s computer who plays this game and you are still unable to stop hackers. Yes, at the end of the day its just a game but I’m a competitive person...always have been, always will be. Things like this need to be addressed and it is starting to get out of hand to the point where I want to stop playing the game, I don’t care if I lose...I just want to know I was outmatched not cheated. If you could put as much time into the anti-cheat as you did with the elderflame skins...I think we’d be in a much better boat right now.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hello everyone! I hope you are all doing well during this difficult time.\\n\\nI am looking for some advice on how to make valorant fun. I am trying to climb, currently stuck going back and forth between bronze 2 and 3. I have just been getting really frustrated with the game, whether it's norms or ranked. I am trying to keep the mentality of what can I do to improve, but I find it difficult to keep that mentality. I find myself getting frustrated at not only myself but my teammates too.\\n\\nI have seen videos of what to do to improve. I have been trying to use the practice range before I go play norms. To practice my aim and reflexes. But when I feel comfortable, and I see that I do well when I play one or two normal games, all of that goes out the window when I play competitive. What else should I be doing to improve and help me climb the ranked later? I am trying to stick with 2 agents but I can't decide on which two. I really like viper, I find that I can do some pretty crazy plays but I know she isn't in the best spot as far as agents go. I don't know who else to play tho. Any suggestions would be most appreciated.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Sure, incentivizing individual performance could theoretically lead to overly aggressive plays in a desperate attempt to get kills. But that rarely happens, because people learn very quickly that holding an angle and having good positioning gets them far more kills than mechanical aim. Frankly speaking, most things that benefit a player\\'s individual performance also benefits the team.\\n\\nYes, I know that valorant already has individual performance \"accounted for\" in ranks below immortal, but the weightage is simply not enough. If you are match mvp with 32:17 kd and lose the match 10:13, there is no way that you should be able to drop rank.\\n\\nThe only consequence of this unfair system is frustrating solo queue, which I suppose has its roots in league. I think you can only start to truly appreciate the game when you 5-stack (or if by chance you are with 4 others who communicate and coordinate in solo queue, which let\\'s be fair, is very very rare), which is simply unfeasible for a lot of people.',\n",

Then, jason who was already dead and spectating, asked him why didn't he shoot the guy behind the smoke. I thought that was interesting, because I belive a big reason of why the smokes are the way they are on Valorant is to avoid issues like this, so I went ahead to jason's stream to clip it and compare.\\n\\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/wqhEmYu) you can see a frame to frame comparison (or as close as I could get) of both POV's.

       "   'selftext': \"Viper, as a controller, should be seen as an alternative to Brimstone or Omen, and she actually has all the tools she needs to fill the role. She has two decent mollies, the biggest smoke in the game, and her wall, which in my opinion, is the best LoS-blocking ability in the entire game. So why isn't she as popular as the other controllers? \\n\\n# 1. Ease of Use\\n\\nThis is hands down her biggest problem. As mentioned before, Viper has all the utility she needs to execute, and also defend a site. The issue is that she can't do it properly. Viper has to equip her smoke, throw it, wait for it to land, and finally activate it. Meanwhile, Brimstone and Omen can both pinpoint exactly where they want their smokes to go, and can do so without exposing themselves or using complicated lineups. This alone already makes Viper a far less attractive option. To make things even worse, she has to be within cuddling distance of her smoke to pick it up, and as a result, she is forced to commit to smoking a single location, and requires a long time to prepare her smoke to use it on another location. This is, once again, a problem other controllers simply don't have to deal with.\\n\\nHer wall also had this problem, but after the buffs it is now very easy to use effectively and no longer requires lineups. There is little reason to not buff her poison orb in a similar way.\\n\\n# 2. Presence\\n\\nCypher's Cyber Cages make noise if the enemy pushes through them. That means it's suicide to walk into it instead of waiting it out, since it is very easy for Cypher to shoot through his smokes to punish anyone trying to walk into site. \\n\\nBrimstone and Omen can smoke a single location multiple times, forcing the enemy to push through them if they want to take control of a choke point. If this is not necessary, they can use their smokes in different locations.\\n\\nAnd guess what, Viper has none of those benefits. If she uses *all* her fuel, the poison orb lasts 15s (same time of Brim and Omen smokes), and so does the wall. If both are activated at the same time, her fuel barely lasts 10s. Which just isn't worth it. After her fuel is fully depleted, she has to wait 20 whole seconds for it to fully recharge. Therefore, she has to wait 20s to use use ONE of her abilities for another 15s.\\n\\nAs a result, it's simply impossible for Viper's utility to be as present as the other controllers' utility. She can only smoke one spot at a time, and it isn't any harder to push through her smoke wheh compared to Brim or Omen smokes since the Decay debuff does nothing. \\n\\n# 3. Possible Solutions\\n\\nI believe Viper doesn't need more raw map control power, since she already has plenty. What she needs is more ways to use her utility effectively. Her entire kit is strong, but she needs to have an easier time taking advantage of it. So how should she be changed? Here are some suggestions:\\n\\n* Remove the faster depletion of her fuel if both of her abilities are active (or even better, make her fuel recharge faster)\\n* Allow Viper to pick up her smoke from a distance, just like Cypher can pick up his camera and traps\\n* Change the Fragile debuff so it lasts 2-4 seconds after leaving the AoE (So Viper has a better opportunity to punish anyone pushing through it)\\n\\nThese are relatively small changes that, when combined, are pretty substantial. If they STILL aren't enough, here are some crazier, maybe unbalanced ones:\\n\\n* Let Viper re-use her wall after 35s (just like any other signature ability). If she deploys a new wall, the previous one just disappears.\\n* Make the Decay debuff much more aggressive, dealing damage slightly faster, but more importantly, making it so it takes a very long time to fully recover from the debuff. The main focus of this is to make her ult actually scary to walk inside of.\\n\\nIf you're still here, thanks for reading! If you're wondering why i didn't talk about her ult as much, it's because i honestly don't know how to buff it without making it extremely overpowered. It surely is in an awkward spot right now, but i don't think it's as bad as people say it is.\",\n",

That being said most matches I get into nobody is really talkative and is very serious on the match which is ok. \\n\\nHowever, instead of dead air between someone yelling that the Raze outplayed them I usually spark up conversation between a player or two. “Hey man that skin is dope or what’s new for you guys?” Usually this ends up in more conversations and gives a better vibe to the team. Instead of calling each other out for bottom fragging it leads to tips and advice as well as cheering each other on. \\n\\nSo my point is loosen up a little bit, it’s not like you are gonna run into this people often. Be chill, and have fun guys. That’s the reason we all play this game.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I\\'m of the opinion that in a skill-based game the first bullet should always be 100% accurate, let the recoil and RNG begin after the first bullet, with the second or third bullets and so forth.\\n\\nIf you test this theory and aim DEAD CENTER of the target bullseye in practice from 50m away, bind a keyboard button to Fire (to prevent accidental mouse movements), and shoot 1 bullet at a time, waiting for recoil to fully reset... Your single shot will land in a random spot.\\n\\nShoot 50 times and you\\'ll have almost 50 different bullet holes (or however many can exist before they disappear, you get the picture).\\n\\nWhen you finish, bring the bullseye close to you at 5m again and you can see just how wide the RNG is for the first bullet. \\n\\nIn fact, you can test this on the actual target dummy at 50m\\n\\nJust aim at his head perfectly on center and then do the same test. Not all of your bullets will even hit his head.\\n\\nThis RNG will translate into the game over time and people with bad luck will have streaks of occasions where their 100% accurate shots are missing completely, leading to unfair advantages due to RNG\\n\\nWe can argue that the RNG is  fair because everyone has to contend with it, but that\\'s not how skill based games such as this should work in my view.\\n\\nI understand many will argue and say \"get good\" but you\\'re missing the point entirely. It isn\\'t about how good you are, it\\'s about the fact that there is a 100% RNG element to your first bullet and you will regularly be in situations where you should have landed a headshot but it went right past their ear even though you aimed 100% accurately.\\n\\nI think that they should patch the game and remove RNG from the FIRST bullet only, so that it rewards accuracy and does not reward Accuracy + Luck, while punishing that same Accuracy - Luck.',\n",

My proposed idea to help counteract this could be to divide Viper's wall in half.\\n\\nThis would allow her to be able to use one wall in pre-round for whichever site she's on, and then have a secondary wall for retakes. I think this could turn her into a very potent attacker and defender because she would now be able to cut off two sizeable lines of sight, allowing her team to be able to get site control by splitting up the enemy team's vision with her walls.\\n\\nUsing Bind A as an example, she could still theoretically have her wall control both sites on defense if she quickly set both up, but if she only set up A, after a potential sage wall plant by Truck, she could use her second wall to cut off Lamps and deny attacker's which hold there any sight.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLogistics may be confusing with two walls, considering currently the wall is\\n\\nE - Place - Activate - Deactivate\\n\\nBut a possible solution could simply be to use F as the activator for the walls.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI'd love some feedback and discussion because this is actually a change that I would really love to see Viper get.

       "   'selftext': 'I just came off a Bronze ranked game and for the umpteenth time had a player or group of players blatantly make racist remarks against me. \\n\\nI am from India but live in Canada, moved here not very long ago and I have a distinct Indian accent. I am active on voice chat regardless and keep making short useful call outs about where enemies are etc. the usual stuff. I come from Overwatch and I did the same in that game too.\\n\\nIn most of my Valorant games this is welcomed and seldom even appreciated. But very very frequently, especially in Unranked mode, I have people make fun of my race, my accent, or downright tell me I don\\'t belong here etc. \\n\\nI am an adult in my 30s and my immediate reaction is to tell them to stop (To be honest I do get angry on occasion) and then mute them if they continue and then report them. I am not sure if reporting helps in terms of action taken.\\n\\nInsults range from mimicking the accent (not playfully I am on board with that), saying I belong to tech support, \"You know you are the wrong servers, right?\" to even blatantly calling names.\\n\\nI have experienced some of this in Overwatch too but the sheer number of incidents in the one month of Valorant is alarming. The most depressing aspect is most of these comments are made by kids way way younger than me, some sound like they are not even out of lower grades of school yet.\\n\\nI know I can avoid some of this by not solo queuing. But that is not the answer! I want to play the game on my terms.\\n\\nTLDR: Here is my take on this and my reason for this post, I am strong enough and old enough to deal with this but we as a gaming community need to safeguard fellow gamers especially younger ones from this menace. If you see any body being racially abused on either team, \"Speak Up!\". I have not had a single teammate come to my aid on these various instances in Valorant. Also, Riot should make sure these reports are taken seriously and some feedback on action taken be sent back to the person(s) reporting. I also suggest adding a separate category if required. In the climate we live in and Black Lives Matter movement etc. I am shocked at the state of mind of the younger generation on the NA servers at least. It is deeply disturbing.',\n",

They said that they scanned my account and found evidence \"related to the usage of scripts, hacks, exploits, or unauthorized third-party programs\".\\n\\nI don\\'t do any of this- I click on people and throw fireballs and junk. And I was having a great time too!\\n\\nCustomer support also said they couldn\\'t disclose any information about my case, in the fear that I\\'m some kind of bot trying to get info on how cheaters get taken out of the game, and the ticket was closed.\\n\\nI don\\'t pirate crap, I do use Discord and I have NVIDIA GeForce installed which both try to use an overlay- but I can\\'t imagine this would get me perma-banned.\\n\\nObviously, this is pretty upsetting, and I know I can\\'t truly prove on here that I haven\\'t been cheating but I\\'ve come to you, Reddit, because I don\\'t really have any other options.

If you somehow end up without enough smokes you are basically screwed.

       "   'selftext': 'Before the pitchforks come out, here are some good reasons that I haven’t seen anyone mention:\\n\\n• Combats smurfing: Good high elo players HAVE to still keep playing on their main accounts otherwise they might miss out on the end rewards.\\n\\n• Combats toxicity/afk: I have seen plenty of posts on here of riot punishing people for 1hour+ for being afk/toxic. Again, encourages people to not afk/toxicity so they can actually play and get exp.\\n\\n• Makes the end rewards more prestigious: This kind of comes down to human psychology, but we enjoy rarer/prestigious things. A lot of people have the kingdom spectre skin. When I pick it up, I couldn’t care less. When I pick up the Exe dot vandal, that looks cool ASF. If everyone had the vandal skin at level 5, I eventually would also not give a fuck same as the kingdom spectre. \\n\\nAnother example: All the rappers wearing gucci belts, looked cool initially. Now drug dealers and wannabes wearing them, looks trash now.\\n\\n• If you cannot finish the BP, you still get your moneys worth: As long as you reach level 45 which is doable as calculated in other posts with 1-2 hours a day. You still get 12skins for £10. And thats not including 100 radiant points (worth £90) and all the other cosmetics.\\n\\n• Makes you better at the game: The more you play, the better you get. Win-win for both you and riot.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"So, I wanted to play Valorant with my friend from Brazil. My idea was to use a VPN and make my account look like i'm in Brazil. That didn't work as we still couldn't invite eachother. \\n\\nAnyway, I made a new account.(I forgot to turn on the VPN and it was an EU account....)\\n\\nI connected back on the VPN and I made another account that is brazil region. Now that works, I can play games with him. We played and it was fun.\\n\\nNow, here comes the issue, when I try to log in back to my account it doesn't allow me. It tells me that I don't need to select a region anymore and other stuff. Thing is, that was a LOL account on EUNE. Pointing this out as it did allow me connect to my new EU account that I made without having the VPN on.\\n\\nAttached there is a video showing how I did it as when I signed out I deleted some files from Local folder.\\n\\n[Here is that video, I explained everything there in more details](https://youtu.be/wVuxTFmtJKk)\\n\\nCan someone help me from Riot? I also submitted a ticket, but I want to post here as well to make people aware.\\n\\nTL:DR: I used a VPN to log in to my account to play with my brazilian friend and now my account is locked.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hello everyone !\\n\\nI'd like to discuss a problem I encounter more than frequently. Since I can't see every aspect of it I would love for you to discuss it with me and help me resolve it. I'm sure you all have some inputs on this issue, pro and cons, and can help me determine if this is a really bad idea or just not a fully thought concept. \\n\\nThe question is **whether or not a game with a DCed player should count, and if so should it weight as much as a normal game on your MMR ?** \\n\\nI'm a bit tilted right now, but I'm convinced not : the player DCed should have a penalty but the player staying should have a decrease of MMR loss, due to playing a game way harder than expected.\\n\\nBut i'm sure there is downside to such an idea, and I'm wondering what they are and if they justify the non-implementation of such a system.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere is the story of what happened and why I'm so tilted ^(because I need to vent) , but it's irrelevant to the discussion so feel free to skip. Although, **this story also explain why I'm certain no such system is in place** in Valorant right now : \\n\\nI'm stating that because yesterday I lost two games due to dc, which made me unrank from Plat3 (probably close to diamond since I was in a win streak) to Plat1 in not more than three games. The first one was due to the server bug that happened yesterday evening in EU, which disconnected three player in my team including me, and none in the other. I succeded to join the game in the last round, just to watch three of my teammates struggling to handle a 3v5. Since the game was supposed to be in our favor (some golds in the enemy team, so higher overall MMR for us), and we lost 5-13, I got deplated to plat 2. I would consider this unfair for two reason : first we were winning 5-0 but we lost due to a server bug. Second, I'm sure my teammates didn't deserve such a hard loss. I won the game after that but there's nothing to tell here (I do have to admit I was underperforming though) . I then lost a second game where my teammates decided to rundown without shooting after our Brim decided to insult all of us and RQ after only 3 round lost in defence. The thing is, had he not RQ we could have won this, or at least not lose at 3-13. But he did, we lost the game hard, and I got once again deplated to Plat1. \\n\\n*Sorry for the salt.*\",\n",

After receiving feedback from my previous post [\"Longest Game Possible in Valorant\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hctkry/what_is_the_longest_possible_game_in_valorant/) I decided to make this as a text post for different ways to digest the information. For this information in a video format, here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4hgB3tafLQ\\n\\nThis post mainly focuses on game sense/mechanics since I covered a lot of tips, tricks, and other info in my previous posts and video which can be found here: \"[15 Tips to help you improve your gameplay \\\\(Reddit Link\\\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/ggjklg/15_tips_to_help_you_improve_in_valorant_in_less/), [\\\\(Direct Link\\\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_bbFenDEOw)\" and \"[10 Gameplay Tips &amp; Info to Help you Improve at Valorant in Less than 2 Minutes \\\\(Reddit Link\\\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/gygf5e/10_gameplay_tips_info_to_help_you_improve_at/), [\\\\(Direct Link\\\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0ZrRik4I5k)\"\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nBackground: In Beta I placed in Gold 1 and was able to rank up to Diamond 2. For Act I, I went 3-2 in placements and was placed in Plat 3. After 36 games, I was able to hit Immortal with a 58% Win Rate. I have a lot of experience with FPS Games, mainly CS:GO and Overwatch. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nGameplay Tips &amp; Knowledge\\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Aiming**\\n\\n* Great aim comes with experience and building muscle memory. The basics of having good aim is ensuring you are used to your in-game sensitivity and dpi and maintain crosshair placement to be at head level. I would recommend going into the practice range and start with achieving a perfect score on easy mode and then achieving a perfect score on medium. There is enough delay between each bot that will help you get in the habit of adjusting your aim after you flick to the next target. Personally, on hard mode I usually score around 17-24. \\n* Another thing I noticed is that I should be holding wider angles instead of close angles to a corner. For some reason, many players decide to wide swing instead of jiggle peeking when turning a corner or wall. \\n* There are many guides out there that goes more in-depth into aiming, personally I would recommend Ron “Rambo” Kim’s content to get a better understanding of aiming. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Team Compositions**\\n\\n* Team comps are very important as you approach into higher ranks. This is mainly due to the operator meta. Having Sage and Cypher are usually a must, along with a brimstone or an omen, and then filling in the rest with an additional control agent or two duelists. Games where you have 3 or 4 duelists become way more difficult because you don’t have the utility to defend a site or block off angles. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Utility Usage**\\n\\n* Use your utility effectively and make sure you don’t waste it. After having to play sage for almost 50% of all my competitive games, I learned how important saving utility is. \\n* On defense, utility is used to slow down the enemy and waste their time. The amount of times I’ve seen a sage just throw down her wall randomly or use both slow orbs at the beginning of the round is too high. \\n* On offense, utility is used to gain control the map. Don’t smoke or molly or slow chokepoints &amp; areas that your team needs to push. Even at higher ranks I see this happening often. \\n* Another example: on the Map Split, on defense side I like to peek mid from mail room. After my first shot I run back, however the enemy team usually adapts to this and will rush me the moment I fire my shot. Instead of just running away or trying to place a wall down, I would place a slow instead and re-aim while moving backwards. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Eco Rounds &amp; Round after Pistol**\\n\\n* Eco Rounds are always winnable: I believe the shorty has such a huge impact in this game. For 200 credits, you can disrupt the opponents economy by securing at least 1 kill. If you play with the shorty correctly, you can even win the round if you are able to get a kill and secure a better gun.\\n* I always communicate to my team to be careful of the enemy team being aggressive or playing close angles when their eco is bad. Make sure to either play default or together. \\n* The second round after pistol round is also very important. This round is played out in several different ways: losing team could force buy, players can go light armor with phantom/vandal, everyone goes full armor bulldog, winning team keeps ghosts and goes full armor, losing team goes all shorties. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Winning &gt; Personal Performance**\\n\\n* After playing many ranked games, winning games with round differences is more important than your personal performance. There is a difference in playing aggressive, where you can surprise the enemy verse hunting for kills which ends up with you feeding.\\n* One of the biggest mistakes I have seen is where the attacking team is able to eliminate two people and secure a site and plant the spike, but botches up the post plant hold since they decide to chase after the remaining enemies and lose duels one by one which ultimately loses the round. \\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Trading Kills &amp; Baiting**\\n\\n* Stop baiting your teammates and learn to trade kills. If your team is pushing, don’t stand 20 feet behind them, you should be able to fight the enemy almost immediately after your teammate engages with them. \\n* If you play a duelist, **and I emphasize:** most of the time, you should be going in first. Even in Diamond, I have had reyna’s and phoenixes wait for their teammates or me (who is usually playing sage or a control character) to go in first. Your duelist character has utility designed to entry frag, don’t be scared to go in.  \\n\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Toxicity &amp; Tilting**\\n\\n* Toxicity exists at all ranks but try your best to have a positive mindset and try not to get tilted. \\n* In one game, my team had a reyna that ended up going 6-26 and was complaining all game about how he’s unlucky and getting running headshotted all the time. Our whole team tried to keep a positive mindset and told him that its okay and to just play with the team, but he was adamant on how stupid the game was and would continue to lurk and die. Luckily the game ended in a draw.\\n* However on the opposite end, I had a game where I made a huge blunder during the pistol round where I forgot to heal myself and missed several bullets on the opponent and lost the round. One of my teammates stated I was “braindead” and was the worst player that he ever played with. Up to this point, there was no flaming and toxicity that occurred over 12 rounds so far. I got angry and fired back stating that he is playing an entry fragger and he only has 2 kills more than me. We both were angry and just shut up and focused on the game when the next round started. We both started racking up kills and I gave him heals when he requested them and we were able to pull a win from a 5-9 scoreline to 13-9. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**DATA/STATS**\\n\\n* Including my placement matches, I played a total of 36 games. My win percentage is 58.3% where I won 21, Lost 14, and had one draw. I played 29 games in Patch 1.2 and 7 games in Patch 1.3. \\n* My average placement on the scoreboard is 4.89, I was MVP twice when I played Raze and was at the bottom two times and that was when I was playing Sage. \\n\\nAcross 36 Games: \\n\\n* I played a total of 778 rounds where I won 420 of them and lost 358. I had a total of 613 kills, 550 deaths, and 239 assists (which is 1.11 KD) and I averaged 17 kills, 15 deaths, and 6.6 assists per game. \\n* My average Combat score is 228, Average econ rating is 37, Average KD is 1.2, Average Damage per Round was 134.27 and Average Kill Per Round was .8. \\n* My average game time was 38 Minutes and 11 seconds, with the shortest game being 26 minutes and 18 seconds (score line was 13-3) and my longest game was 52 minutes and 4 seconds with a score line of 14-14. \\n* For agent specifics: I played Sage 17 times with a win rate of 53%. MY best agent is raze where I have a 70% win ratio with her over 10 games. \\n* I had a total of 90 first bloods, died first 63 times, and was the last to die 72 times. I also defused the spike 8 times and planted it 70 times. \\n* My average headshot percentage was 11%, bodyshot percentage was 80% and legshot percentage was 9%. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n**Overview**\\n\\nFor my placement matches, I went 3 and 2 and placed in Plat 3. Going from Diamond 3 to Immortal took the same amount of games it did to go from plat 3 to diamond 1. One thing I found out is that you will always be shown 1 down arrow when you lose a game. Even with a scoreline of 1-13 or 11-13, your progress isn’t clear. \\nThe hardest part was trying to rank up in diamond since I would alternate between a win and loss.  from Diamond 2 to Diamond 3, it took me 4 wins where 3 of those games I was able to get 3 green up arrows. \\n\\nThere is a lot of discussion ongoing and I agree with the general consensus that it would be nice if we can see our progress more clearly, I would be fine if it was similar to TFT. I would also like to see a top 500 leaderboard or something similar to challenger &amp; grandmaster in league. \\nIn general, I believe Riot has done a good job with matchmaking and keeping the teams balanced in competitive. I had the occasional game where it was a blow out, but overall most of the games were very close and sweat fests. \\n\\nI definitely see a huge difference in my style of play as well as skill level from when I first started in Beta to where I played my first placement matches to where I am now. Hopefully this video/post provides useful information to you and brings some insight into ranked at a higher level. \\n\\nThanks for reading/watching.',\n",

I\\'m still doing fairly well, and can \"carry\" and help coordinate my team into smart plays. I created a second account to get more practice in comp and currently in my placements I\\'m cresting low diamond. I can do fairly well, as aim generally isn\\'t an issue, but I\\'m struggling with where to play and when to play aggressive. I seem to die a lot, which wouldn\\'t be that bad as I\\'m normally an initiator (mostly play reyna) but i need to die less getting caught out, or playing overall bad positions. I would like some general tips on picking better angles, lurking, and rotating. On my main account I\\'m still at the point where aim is pretty much the deciding factor, but on my alt I am often losing to players who simply seem to peek and hold more effectively than me. I understand its not something I can learn instantly, but any general tips or more specific tips (Reyna strats too!) That i can incorporate would be pretty helpful :) \\n\\nReally want to keep practicing and getting better to take my gameplay to the next level.',\n",

I didn't camp corners with it, I just countered their playstyle, I didn't target her I just countered her. So please tell me if it was toxic to do that.\",\n",

When I dont get kills I still try my best to have good util usage so I'm not useless to my team. On a good game of comp I'll go like 15 kills and 12 deaths or somewhere close to that.

Who thought it was a cool idea to make the game not have HRTF in 2020? Or have things like a freaking ROOMBOT block footstep audio when you're being pushed. You guys spoke a big game and of course you under-delivered. Shock.\",\n",

But the most entertaining matches have been on that map and I like seeing how different teams approach it. Bind is good, although I do feel it\\'s a bit Defender sided right now, with the right changes they can make it work. They\\'ve done a great job on reworking Mid on Split and the map is getting more balanced as more games rain in.

       "   'selftext': 'Hey guys,\\n\\nso I\\'ve recently picked up the game again after only having played the beta and my friends and me were really surprised that the RNG when it comes to the map choice in competitive seemingly still has not been fixed. Out of our 5 games we needed to get a rank we played Split 4 times. After that we played 4 maps of Bind. I completely forgot  that Haven was even a thing and we didn\\'t even get to try out the new map which doesn\\'t seem right.\\n\\nAfter that I read on the \"Ask-Valorant\"-thing this week that they don\\'t plan to implement a map-choice-queue like CSGO does with the reasoning that they don\\'t want to split the playerbase and have longer queue times than needed. I really have to ask - Riot: are you aware you only have 4 maps? There\\'s no playerbase to split over those. When Split came up the 4th time yesterday my friends and me were already settled to quit the game after the map. It\\'s not even because we were mad or anything, we were just bored. Imagine playing 80 rounds straight on one map...\\n\\nI want to list a few brainstormed suggestions here to maybe fix this:\\n\\nYou could make players who have played a map multiple times in a row a \"priority\" and have the RNG not pick that map again. Say 5/10 players in a lobby have played Split 4 times out of their last 5 matches. Split will then be banned for that lobby without telling the players. The parameters for this could be easily tuned.\\n\\nWith a system like the one in CSGO, you could have it that to play ranked, players have to select at least 2/3 maps to start the queue. This wouldn\\'t split the playerbase because the intersections would always be large enough to ensure short queues. \\n\\nYou could let players ban 1 map when a lobby has formed so after playing a map 3 times your premade team can at least make sure that SOME variety is gonna happen.\\n\\nIn Quake Champions players are presented with 3 randomly picked maps which they can then vote on. This would have to be experimented with but I\\'d say it would be at least more unlikely to play a map 4 times in a row.\\n\\nThe last 3 options are especially interesting to me because riot would also get data on which map players like best/least. At this moment they only have this sub and maybe a forum somewhere to fall back on because the ingame map choice is random. But letting all players vote on their favourite maps would help them identifiy which maps need work.\\n\\nFeel free to share more ideas or tear mine apart because I didn\\'t think about them hard enough :p',\n",

These weapons should be instantly equipable in the middle of a game, and he doesn’t lose them when he dies. \\n\\n2. I also feel like brims ULT is very imbalanced. In order to balance it out, I believe that if he uses his ULT on the spike, it should melt it into oblivion, resulting in an automatic win for his team. I also believe he should be able to use it whenever he wants because he is *the* brim daddy. \\n\\n3. His molly is also super underwhelming. He should have an unlimited supply that he can launch into every corner. Once a player touches it, it should signal an alert on his wrist causing it to instantly burst into flames, engulfing and killing the enemy. (Only person immune to this is the brim daddy on the other team, just to make it a little more fair &amp;amp;lt;3) he will simply be left at one hp. \\n\\n4. His smokes. I believe that his smokes, when entered, should cloud the enemies vision with dust. As they leave, they should begin to cry from the pain and have their screen fogged up with tears, making it impossible to hit head shots or use abilities. \\n\\n5. brim daddy’s suit. He is wearing very thick armor, I believe this means he should be immune to all body and leg shots from every gun. He should be knife immune too and block all damage from agent abilities. This will result in enemy agents having to bow down to him in defeat and beg him for mercy to throw the game, which of course he won’t because he is *the* brimstone. \\n\\n6. Lastly, we can all agree brim daddy is the hottest agent in the game. Hes a sexc soldier. He’s the hottest agent that will ever exist. He can swoon anyone he comes across. I believe he should have a “winking” feature. This would cause any agent he crosses paths with to freeze and immediately faint after he winks at them, allowing him to swoop in for a kill. \\n\\n\\nSo yeah. These are just some *minor* buffs that will make brimestone a more fair agent to play. These buffs shouldn’t be too hard to implement and I hope I can see these in the next patch. I think I was a bit lenient here but let me know what you think!',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I play a lot of Viper and I think the biggest issue/ buff she really needs has to do with her ult, because currently, it feels incredibly unwieldy. It would be nice if it actually covered its entire radius all the time and not stopping because of random terrain and weird environmental interactions that mess with its radius. But more importantly, what I think her ult REALLY needs is a quality of life change! Ie, when you are casting it and when it is active, it should SHOW allies the radius that it covers on the map. Because a lot of times when I cast the ult, only God knows what dimensions the ult covers. This fact alone makes Viper's ult INCREDIBLY difficult for you and your team to play around because no one has any idea what angles are being covered by it and what isn't. And that is my opinion why Viper's ult is a lot of the time is not considered very beneficial to your team.\\n\\nBut if Riot thinks the quality of life improvements to Viper's ult isn't enough for whatever reason, it would be nice if the damage on Viper's wall becomes more noticeable. Due to the nature of how decay damage works and how thin/ short of a time enemies are in the wall before they pass through it... Her wall might as well not have any decay because it is that non-noticeable.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"In no particular order I'm going to list off tactics or tricks or habits that I've noticed among players\\n\\n- 1. **Baiting out utility by giving your position away, trading utility or other resources**\\n\\nBy giving away my position via shooting or movement, it's possible for the enemies to believe that there are more than just 1 person. This could lead to them using their utility. By shooting bullets into nothing can have a similar effect.\\n\\nTrading utility. By smoking off chokes and common angles, it's possible to get enemies to waste utility in preparation of a push.\\n\\n- 2. **Using your pistol/gun on destructible panels (Haven and Ascent)**\\n\\nOn Haven and Ascent, there are destructible panels that have 500 HP (idk if this is exact). After being destroyed the walls can be penetrated by bullets normally. Using your pistol to break these can help clear out common hiding spots. \\n\\nAs an attacker on Haven, you can shoot the panels on Garage door. As a defender on Ascent, you can shoot the panels on B Link, Mid Link, Mid Connector, w/e you call it.\\n\\n- 3. **Giving away your position by accident**\\n\\nThis applies to mostly Omen and Reyna and a lesser degree to Cypher. Omen and Reyna's flashes are shown on the minimap, on top of that, they come from the body out. This means that enemies can tell where a Reyna or Omen is by looking at the minimap. This can apply to Cypher, but only when his camera is activated. \\n\\nStabbing with your Knife creates sound, so don't go randomly walking and stabbing as if it's quiet.\\n\\n- 3.1. Related to point 3 but more of an it's own topic, **reloading a gun unnecessarily**. \\n\\nMost non-pistols can kill with less than 1/2 the clip, reloading can not only be dangerous by being vulnerable by reloading, but it can give enemies a general direction of where your position is.\\n\\n- 4.  **If the spike is dropped and you have time, try to attack from a different angle**\\n\\nI've seen many times where players stand for 30s holding an angle then walk in and take the 1v3. If you have time, try to attack from a different angle. Go for a loop around, go pick up that ultimate orb on the other side of the map, there are many things you could be doing instead of standing around.\\n\\n- 5. **Predicting where and how the enemies will play**\\n\\nI've often found myself trying to guess where and how the enemies will play the round. Works best for early rounds or against teams that like to rush. A common thing I've found is teams that lose round 1 usually won't rush that same site a second time, also, failing a rush usually leads to teams trying a different site. \\n\\nAdapting to the enemies playstyle is also important. If you know the enemies have been playing slow, try to space out your utility more or switch it up all together. For example, Brimstone likes to smoke at the start of the round, but you could delay that smoke a few seconds or maybe change where you place it. These small adjustments could throw off the enemies.\\n\\n- 6. **Switch things up**\\n\\nBy switching your playstyle and where each teammates plays (Defender side) you can catch the enemies off guard. Some rounds try playing aggressive and others maybe super safe. Also by switch up where agents play can have a huge impact, not only is it a playstyle difference but the difference in agent abilities could secure you a round. Switch it up and see how things go.\\n\\n- 7. **Practice using pistols**\\n\\nEverybody understands that it's fundamental to learn the general spray pattern of the rifle and controlling it at a distance, but just as important are the pistols. You start every game and half using pistols, winning the first round can secure an additional 3 round afterwards. Learning to shoot slower and controlling the aim of pistols are important too!\\n\\nUnrelated to pistols but to Pistol Round, if you're not the best aimer, try buying players that are your entry fraggers or top fraggers a pistol instead. This way they can afford Light Shield and maybe additional abilities. You just sit back and let them carry\\n\\n- 8. **Bad callouts are worse than no callouts. Make good callouts or make none at all**\\n\\nI'm definitely guilty of this one. Making bad calls can lose your team the round. False or bad information is damaging to the team because it could cause them to overrotate or maybe make them unable to hear something or can cause doubt of their own decisions. You're better off being quiet then being loud and wrong. \\n\\nSome good callouts are:\\n\\nYou have 6 shots left.\\n\\nX enemy player was last seen at X location.\\n\\nX enemy player has no more (utility, flashes, smokes, molly, ammo, etc)\\n\\nX enemy player has ult, watch out.\\n\\nI have no more (utility, flashes, smokes, molly, ammo, etc).\\n\\n- 9. **If your team is saving, save. If your team is buying, buy.**\\n\\nYou can lose rounds by not communicating your intentions with your econ. Giving the enemy team a Phantom on round 2 while all your teammates have Ghost can easily throw the round. Buying an Op while all your teammates are stuck on pistols probably will left you broke on the next round and the enemy team with an extra Op\\n\\nThese were most of the things I could list off the top of my head. Are there some things you disagree on? I'd like to hear about it.\\n\\n- 10. **If you have time, plant more in the open**\\n\\nThere are better plant spots than default. Plant in a spot that can be held from more angles\",\n",

I hope some of you have had the chance to leave ideas for the subreddit on our [Feedback Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hl4rtm/state_of_the_subreddit_feedback_thread_1/). If you haven\\'t, it is something we still encourage users to check out. Based off some community feedback we will be addressing some new rules/additions.\\n###These rules will not count retroactively, any posts that are currently up will not be removed under these rules, only posts created after this announcement will be enforced under these rules.\\n\\nFirstly, we are implementing a 100 character minimum for all text posts. We have noticed that the majority of posts with low word count fall under our \"no low-effort\" rule. This rule is aimed at creating more meaningful discussions by requiring users to go a little more in depth with their topic by being more descriptive.\\n\\nThis rule will be an addition to our current \"[**No low-effort submissions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/about/rules/)\" rule:\\n\\n&gt;All text submissions must have a 100 character minimum in the body text. Posts that only consist of short title references like \"Title\", \"That is all\", \"\\\\^\", etc will be removed.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe\\'ve noticed a lot of cases where there has been confusion regarding the application of some of our rules. We have made a few clarifications regarding Direct Address, Private Individuals, and Spam/Self-Promotion to hopefully make them clearer.\\n\\nWith our direct address rule, there have been many occasions where users do not know why their post was removed. This subreddit is designed for users to talk with the community and not a forum to directly talk to Riot. This rule is specifically meant to target posts such as \"Dear Riot, Please add \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ to the game\", but there are still more subtle ways to directly address Riot that we will remove posts for. Riot is active in the community and will often comment on a thread. We are currently working on finding a good way to highlight Riot responses on threads while also allowing them the freedom to casually interact and not feel the need to always answer with a \"professional\" response.\\n\\nThis rule will be an addition to our current \"[**No Direct Address**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/about/rules/)\" rule:\\n\\n&gt;Some common words and phrases that are considered direct address include: \"Please add/change/fix\" and \"Can we add/get/fix.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\nIn [our previous set of new rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/gz6r5g/new_rules_clips_stream_promos_and_private/), we introduced the concept of private individuals and banned posts explicitly calling out such individuals. Given that there was some (admittedly understandable) confusion about who qualifies as a private individual, we will be adding the following section to our current Private Individuals rule:\\n\\n&gt;Private individuals are those who do not place themselves in public view by way of content creation or media presence. This could include methods such as videos, articles, humor, etc.\\n\\nAn important consequence of this definition is that high elo players (even Radiant players) are also classified as private individuals, unless they stream/create videos/etc. This means that posts calling out high elo players must be censored unless they are public individuals.\\n\\nAs a reminder, this subreddit is not the place to report some random cheater in your ranked games. **If you encounter a cheater in any rank, you can report them using the in-game report feature as well as creating a ticket at Riot support with proof of said cheater.**\\n\\n---\\n\\nOur spam/self-promotion rule has previously been laid out in terms of percentages, but, we\\'ve decided to move from the current vague definition of 10% to the following \"[**Spam/Self-Promotion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/about/rules/)\" rule:\\n\\n&gt;Do not spam; no more than 3/25 of your last submissions on Reddit should be self-promoting content.\\n\\n&gt;Excessive spam is not allowed. Self-promotion is allowed as long as the content is relevant to VALORANT and does not break one of the other rules. You may only self-promote if at least 23 of your last 25 posts/comments are organic discussion on all of Reddit.\\n\\nThis change creates a *slightly* less strict ratio as well as hopefully makes it clearer for users to know when they are breaking the rule.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOn a special note, the mod team wanted to give thanks to users /u/PK_Fr33Z3 and /u/Vacre. They are responsible for the new subreddit icon and we are excited to see more community work!',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hi all, I've been loving Valorant since it came out, it's a nice break from CS when I need it. I'm not that great of a player (Silver 2 in CS, low Gold/high Silver in Valorant) and I don't play every day, but when I do trying to deal with the negative mental aspects of the game has been really challenging for me. I'd love to hear how other people manage it. The ranking system seems to be pretty fluid, which is great when I'm ranking up but incredibly stressful when I'm doing poorly. I haven't played consistently since last week, but I was on a hot streak (went from Silver 2 to Gold 1 in a few days) after winning or losing (a close one while top fragging) a few games in a row, and I was feeling pretty good about it. I picked up the game today, lost the first game, and instantly deranked to Silver 3. I know it shouldn't matter to me, but losing and deranking sucks, and when I consider myself to be playing poorly it really affects how I play and how I think while I'm playing. I start worrying that I'm going to derank, that I'm not actually supposed to be in Gold and that it was a fluke, etc.; basically just doubting and criticizing the hell out of myself. It makes playing close games way more stressful than it should be (instead of fun). Tilting sucks, but it seems like when I'm in a rut mid-game I quickly get stuck in a downward spiral. This isn't so much a problem in CS (I've been Silver 2-3 for a few hundred hours now) so I don't really care, but the fluidity of ranks in Valorant makes it seem much more pressing. Does anyone have some mental strategies they've used to stop worrying so much? I love playing (even solo queuing!) but sometimes it seems like I've created a situation where I have to win or do well to have fun, and obviously that doesn't always happen. It's embarrassing to admit, but it's true. Any advice?\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hey guys! So I feel like we all know that from all the agents, Viper is probably the one that feels the less powerful from the current roster. I had some ideas that could potentially make her a more valuable addition to a team. Keep in mind that I am in no way a professional so I might not know  everything about higher rank play style. So any way, let’s go through every abilities\\n\\n\\nC- Snakebite:\\n\\n\\n In my opinion this is the ability that don’t really need any changes it is similar to brimstone molly or Phoenix’s fireball. Some people suggested that Viper should be able to walk through it without taking damage but I don’t really think that it is an issue \\n\\n\\nQ- Poison cloud:\\n\\n\\nThis is the ability I really would change. In essence this is just a smoke. Yes it does inflict decay but at a really slow pace and the health is regained rapidly. Therefore, if we compare it with other smokes available for other characters it’s easy to see how weak it is. First of all you need to have line of sight of where you want to throw it or at least be really near it. The only other character who needs that to place smokes is Jett and her whole kit revolves around going in and staying out of fire with her dash/jump. Compared to Brimstone or Omen smoke that you can place without putting yourself in danger Viper’s smoke are really limited. Even with the facts that you can activate/deactivate it at will, I feel like the fact Omen gets a new smoke that he can place anywhere on the map every 30 seconds and for free  is just way better. Even Brimstone has 3 smokes which basically means he could also smoke the same angle for a amount of time similar to Viper while also having the ability to put it anywhere else. I had a 2 ideas to make those smokes a little better.\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea 1- keep the same decay and everything but make it so that Vipers vision when she enters the smoke orb is the same as the one we have under Omen’s smokes (seeing everything under the dome) while enemies are short sighted. That would make it really easier for the smoke to be a real threat as entering it with a Viper in it means you have a high chance of dying.\\n\\n\\n\\nIdea 2- Make it so that enemies stay short sighted for a bit of time after getting out of the smoke. That would lead to some interesting on/off plays that would make the character more viable in my opinion.\\n\\n\\nE- Toxic screen\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion the fact that they made the wall go through wall was really the good way to go as the problem with the toxic screen was the same as it now is with the orb, you had to put yourself in danger to put it down. So there is nothing else to change here I believe\\n\\n\\nX- Viper’s pit\\n\\n\\nAs it is this ultimate isn’t useless, it can provide good cover for a spike plant and is a really good repellent for a push on a site if playing defense. But, again, when you compare it to other ultimates available in game it feels like it’s lagging behind. It basically is just a big smoke and the decay isn’t really fast enough to give any real advantage to Viper in most engagements. She also get no vision bonus except the red glow... which Reyna gets for the the whole map without being blinded... so here are my ideas to make it a bit more powerful:\\n\\n\\nIdea 1- Give a vision advantage to Viper\\n\\nIt could just be giving her vision in the smoke a slightly longer reach so that she can at least see the enemies before they do and make it so that her ult is actually advantageous for her and not just a big neutral smoke\\n\\nI also saw a post suggesting that the ultimate could gradually lower the enemies vision up until they are concussed (like breach ultimate and abilities) \\n\\n\\nIdea 2- Give Viper a damage advantage\\n\\n\\nI could see many way of doing this. They could potentially make it so that enemies that stay in the smoke get the “fragile” debuff so that Viper still has an advantage even if she sees the enemies at the same time they see her. However that would be very strong considering that means double damage from anyone and a decay debuff but if they change fragile to deal x1.5 damage or something of the sort it could be balanced and thematic considering Viper is the only one with access to ”fragile”. Another option could be to turn the decay inflicted in some sort of “poison” that would act the same as decay but be permanent damage. It could be something like dealing 99 damage overtime so it can’t actually kill a player but would be another advantage for Viper. They could even reuse the keyword for her snakebite... however in that case because of “fragile” poison could kill. That could lead to some plays with her ult coupled with her snakebite. The snakebite wouldn’t deal double damage since the poison effect would be applied only once but it would allow players to die of the poison.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo here it is guys, how to make Viper better in my humble opinion',\n",

Despite almost none of the performance patches improving FPS for rigs that weren't high end, and despite saying they were going to continually optimize the game, my performance on both my rigs is just, unapologetically awful, with almost no end in sight.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor context, here's the min specs for 144 + frames, taken directly from [https://playvalorant.com/en-us/specs/](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/specs/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\ni5-4460, and a 1050ti. For 144fps +. I have two rigs, one running a 8700k, and a 2070. While my performance there is more than acceptable, I'm not home near as often as I use to be, and as a result, I tend to play on my second rig more. My second rig has a i5 6600k, rx570, and 8 gigs of ram. Despite being more than enough to supposedly reach the 144+ min requirements, the amount of time where I'm actually maintaining this frame-rate is completely marginal. I tend to lock my frame-rate at 144 or 120 given the piss poor performance. But if I unlock it, I'll have highs into the 190-200s. With lows as bad as 80 to 90 fps. Even with the framerate locked, the screen tearing and frame drops are horrendous. With the average probably being around 104. Keep in mind, Valorant devs have even stated that they want performance benefits for lowering settings to be minimal, if not nonexistent. This performance is on the lowest possible settings. Everything at the absolute minimum. I'm talking 4x filtering, no anti aliasing, 720p resolution. lowest settings fucking possible. If I even try to turn textures on medium I'm looking at 90-100 fps average.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow keep in mind, on top of this, my performance in a custom lobby, or in the practice range, is incredibly smooth, with very little spikes overall. The issue, and piss poor performance almost only arrives when I'm in an online match with other players. Which, in my experience points to a CPU optimization issue.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI have a background in IT, and I promise you I've reset my PC, reinstalled Windows, reapplied thermal paste to my CPU and worked on air flow in my case. Despite all this, and the constant attempted workarounds each patch, Valorant is the only game that experiences these types of issues. I typically play Valorant with nothing open in the background, and even having discord running at the same time as Valorant shows massive increases in screen tearing and terrible performance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNothing else on my PC has this issue. Not Sea of Thieves, not Rust, not any of the other games I play, and definitely not one with spec requirements as low as this. I've seen users with the same CPU iterate the same issues. Users with similar specs iterate the same issues. This is not an issue with my specific PC, this is terrible optimization and it's actively keeping me from spending any real amount of time or money on the game as I can't even come close to actually enjoying it. I've heard of players in this subreddit with specs that are lower than this having 144fps CONSTANT. With almost no drops. I'm talking i3's and 1050ti's with constant 144. (according to them).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRiot has said they would keep working on these fixes, now that the most vocal part of the community isn't experiencing them they've all but forgone performance patches. They were more than happy to take the workload when players with 2080ti's and 9900ks were experiencing issues (because how could you optimize a bare bones game so poorly that the top 1% of PC's cant handle it despite having low-med requirements.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPlease. Just fix these issues. There's zero excuse for my current performance. I shouldn't have to pay top dollar for a secondary rig in the hopes that they'll acknowledge and actually tend to the issue. I've sent in tickets, I've posted in the bug threads. I get no reasonable or helpful responses. I just want to enjoy the game.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'First, some background: I am an ex CS player with over 1 hour on the game. I have seen Overwatch on twitch and installed Apex Legends for one week before getting bored. Overall lots of FPS experience.\\n\\nNow, here are the four main tips I kept in mind during my ranked progression\\n\\n1) The first thing you want to do is remove the V key from your keyboard. This is because talking in voice chat will distract your teammates and is a must-not. Instead, spam A, B, or C in the text chat whenever you see an opponent because the entire team is pushing you.\\n\\n2) Agent selection: The most important part of this game is getting kills. Therefore you must always pick Jett, Raze, or Reyna. Practice selecting and locking in your agent in spike rush to make sure you always get who you want. A second tip is to press caps lock during agent selection and type \"SAGE PLS SAGE PLS\" in chat in order to guarantee a well rounded team. (Everyone needs a healer)\\n\\n3) Crosshair placement: I have noticed repeatedly that in high ranks, like silver 1 and 2, player often make the mistake of aiming for the head, forgetting about recoil. Recoil is a feature that makes your bullets go up. To counter this, look directly at the floor at all times so that in any engagement your shots will hit the opponents head as recoil occurs.\\n\\n4) Econ: many new player often make the mistake of buying guns like the phantom. vandal, and operator, along with their abilities. When purchasing these things, players forget that dying will mean they can only buy a pistol. To avoid this, get an stinger, ares, or marshall every round so that you will never need to use bad guns. Abilities aren\\'t important, so don\\'t buy and save cash. If you\\'re feeling extra wealthy, try grapping a frenzy or a shorty to supplement your loadout. \\n\\nHope this helps everyone! Good luck out there!',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Very rarely do I leave a game I just lost and feel like I lost because of a map/character/OP. Everytime I lose I realize I made a lot of small/big mistakes that added up to a loss. Maybe as defenders we were playing mid too agressively so we gave the attackers free kills mid, or as attackers we gave up too much map control at the start so we were easily flanked. Maybe I didnt use my utility enough (omen main) to block off OP sight lines during pushes. \\n\\nThis game can be maddening when your losing, the power level of some agents are insane especially when your opponents have the economic and morale advantage. At times it can feel like there’s nothing you can do, but there is always a way you can outplay your opponents. \\n\\nI realized at a certain point, If each mistake or death tilts me and I always blame the balancing/team mates/hit reg, I will never correct these mistakes and I will stay the same rank or even de rank. \\n\\nThe best way to improve and climb on ladder is to stop and think after a loss. Was there anything I could have done better (aside from aiming)? Was there rounds I didnt use utility that I shouldve used? Do I have poor positioning on defense/post plant on attack? Am I not trading out my team mates when they die near me? Am I dying in places I cant get traded out? These are things I ask myself everytime I die or lose a game. It has allowed me to slowly climb out of silver, into gold and now Im teetering here at plat 1. I still have A LOT to improve on, but if you try and learn from every loss you will improve very gradually over time and your rank will follow. Blaming each loss on something other than my own gameplay will only hold me back from being the best player I can be. \\n\\nIf a certain playstyle, agent or even just the Operator is giving you a really hard time then take the time and find out what you and your team can do to counter them. Theres thousands of tutorials on YouTube already for this game with many more being uploaded everyday! Focus on improving yourself and dont try and tell riot to fix split, nerf the op, or delete raze from the game. Focusing on something so out of your control will only serve to tilt you in game and you will never learn how to play around them. \\n\\nSorry for the long post I just get really sad when I see people just destroying this game in text posts. I seriously believe this game has great hitreg (minus crouching hitboxes those seem busted rn), great agent balance and even better maps. \\n\\nIf you are not having fun, take a break. Play a different game, go hangout with friends, take a walk. This game is incredibly tilting and it is totally okay to log off after a tilting loss streak. Come back with a fresh mind and some new info on how to counter that OPer or raze.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I see all of these posts saying “Viper needs buffs!” And she does, just not for the reasons people think. People are complaining how her smoke isn’t as numerous and lasting and far-reaching as Omen’s or Brimstone’s. People groan about how her snake bite can’t kill anyone and people just push through it. That’s because Viper isn’t supposed to be played like Omen or Brimstone or Phoenix. When I play Viper, I focus on one thing. This word is literally in her description. Mindgames.\\n\\nViper’s screen is definitely the best ability Viper has. It has huge map coverage, and now that it goes through walls, it is absolutely her best ability. I haven’t heard anyone complain about the screen since the update, so instead of berating you for using it wrong, I’m going to elaborate on “mindgames.” The screen is great for pushing into a site without being shot at immediately, but when you use the screen, it’s kinda obvious to the enemy that you are pushing through. So instead, after using the screen to push through a site for a while, switch it up and use the screen to make the enemy think you are pushing that site and instead have your teammates attack another site. This should at least convince some of the enemy team to stay and watch the site the screen is at.\\n\\nViper’s smoke is not great at blocking sight lines. It can’t be thrown very far with precision, and you only have one. So stop trying to use it to block sight lines! (In most cases, her screen can block most if not all sight lines anyway.) Use it to discourage pushing through certain areas or to conceal yourself or both! To those who say the smoke doesn’t last long and takes forever to recharge, Viper gets the ability to decide how long her smoke lasts. Turn it off early to give the enemy the false impression that it won’t turn on for a while, then turn it on again as soon as possible to catch them off guard. Also, if you are hiding inside it, you can actually take advantage of the decay mechanic and boombots basically can’t see you. They have driven past me so many times in Vipers smoke without noticing me at all.\\n\\nViper’s snake bite is weak. It doesn’t deal as much damage as Phoenix’s and Brimstone’s abilities, so oftentimes people will ignore it and move over it. Small brain vipers say “darn.” I say “Yes!” Vipers snakebite inflicts a debuff on anyone standing on it to take DOUBLE DAMAGE! Combined with their health draining, if you shoot at them while they are standing on it, they will disintegrate. This forces them to stand their ground on the acid, or to move off while you are still shooting. You can also use the snake bite on people that are around corners, but that’s pretty obvious.\\n\\nViper’s ult has very mixed feelings, so all I will say is that if you use the ult, make it hard for people to find you. Don’t stand at the edge unless you intend to peek outside. If they travel to the deep part of Viper’s ult, they are decaying a lot. The longer it takes to find you, the more the fight will be in your favor.\\n\\nTL;DR: Stop using Viper like other agents. Use her abilities as mindgames and strike while they are trying to pass through them.',\n",

On attack, the ideal position is to be at the back of a push so that you won't be dying first, and also not to be watching the flank as you need to be in a position to heal your teammates. When your team pushes, toss the slow orbs at common angles/choke points.\\n\\nOn defence, hold any angle passively and be prepared to slow orbs or wall off if you spot a rush coming. Alternatively, you can play from the back of a site, and be the rotating player, giving heals to whoever needs them and delaying a push with your skills.\\n\\nIdeally, your kills should be coming from trades, and from retakes or holding the bomb plant. Don't be disheartened to have little kills on a stomp, that means the entry fraggers are doing their job. Alternatively, you can judge your performance based on your deaths. If you have a low death count, you're already doing your job as a support player, as you can heal 2, or even 3 times just by staying alive.\",\n",

This is most likely due to over utilization of Riots server connection to the internet and everyone connecting to that server is having packet loss. I would guess that the packet loss only occurs during peak usage of the game and not in the middle of the morning or low usage times. This happens with many online games, especially when there is a new update and increased users of their services. If Riot had more bandwidth and less users, this packet loss would probably not be there. Getting a VPN would only change his IP, but probably not how the internet routed his traffic and certainly would not change the internet connection at the Riot server having the issue. We do not rate limit or hinder any traffic on our network based on where it is going, so to us, there would still be no loss or latency to the internet. Both of his traces show 10 ms or less for us with no loss.',\n",

If you lose one game 13-4, you will probably derank. The problem is this happens all the time. I am immortal 3 and I lose games by a large margin all the time. This didn’t happen as much in CSGO. I feel like with certain play styles a team can completely shut down another team. In CSGO it would be rare for me to lose a game 16-4 but I lose games like that in VALORANT all the damn time. Where one team completely obliterates the other team and you don’t know what the hell to do. I think this game requires a lot of team chemistry and proper communication. Hell, I’ve seen pro stacks lose 13-3. If one team plays better together, they will run you over. It doesn’t matter if your team has better mechanical skill. What are your thoughts?',\n",

It was essentially an even match minus team comp (d2, p1,p1,g3,p1) vs the same on the other side. I apologized for instalocking and we didn\\'t have a healer or smokes except for omen on bind. But the WHOLE GAME our team was ultra positive and working together, not complaining, sacrificing for trades and opening sites, etc...and we won 13-9 with an inferior comp.

       "   'selftext': \"As the title says, these are a few small changes that in my opinion will make the game better and feel more polished. I will list them from most likely to happen to least likely.\\n\\n1. **Add a accept/decline match option**\\n\\nI think many people would really appreciate this. Currently when a match is found; you are automatically put into the game; forcing you to either play or to dodge the game which can give you a queue timer.\\n\\nSometimes; people accidentally click unrated when they want competitive, or vise versa; it is too late when they realize as they will already be sucked into their game.\\n\\nLeague offers this option before any match starts; I do not see why it is not in valorant; this looks like a basic thing to have on a competitive game.\\n\\nFurthermore; people might have something that comes up last minute; emergency or not; having that decline option helps to ensure players dont get punished for wanting to no longer play that match before it even begins.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n2. **Ability to choose maps**\\n\\nUnrated should be a way to practice; its unrated for a reason; it does not count towards your competitive rank. Thus making it the best way to learn new agents and maps that you can practice and eventually bring to your competitive play. However; with the lack of the ability to choose which maps you want to play; it is pretty random in what map you get. Currently you have a 25% chance to get any map; there are 4 maps. So you have a 25% of getting the map you want to play and learn. If the map is called bind; you're gonna get that map every game.\\n\\nGiving players the ability to choose which maps they want to queue for in unrated allows them to practice that specific map and get better at it.\\n\\n3. **More experience points to unlock agents and finish the battle pass quicker**\\n\\nThere's a battle pass system; there's a system to unlock agents. Fairly easy, play a game and get xp; do the daily/weekly quests to earn more xp. However; this is not viable for everyone. It still takes a bit of a time for people to do the battle pass or to unlock an agent. Not everyone can spend their time everyday on valorant and certain people may not be able to play more than once a week. Make it easier to do the battlepass and easier to get agents.\\n\\nI think it is important to be able to unlock agents without feeling like its tedious work. You just want to play the agent; you dont want to make it a chore to get it. Yes I know people get two free agents in the beginning but thats not enough for wanting to unlock others. If they are going to increase the amount of agents; they will need to make it easier to get.\\n\\nBattlepass is takes a while to complete; thats fine. However it feels like it takes too much work than it needs too. An increase in xp would make this a lot better and easier.\\n\\n4. **Make battlepass worth it**\\n\\nThe battlepass is not really worth much in my opinion; compared to other battlepasses in games; this one just feels so lackluster with basic/simple skins and other simple rewards like charms, titles, player cards and radiant points. Furthermore; unlike other battle passes; you cant complete the battlepass and have enough points to purchase it for the next season. Each season you need to spend $10 and so far it doesn't seem like the battlepass is worth it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**5. Map creator**\\n\\nProbably the least likely to happen; but a map creator would really help this game. One of the best features of CSGO is the community-made maps; even dust 2 was once made by a simple user of the community. I know they have some of the CSGO map creators making maps on valorant but each map feels similar.\\n\\nIn CSGO, since you had users from the community making maps; you had different styles, feels, ambitions for each map. Dust 2 doesnt play the same like cobblestone; it doesnt feel similar. Nuke is not like Train. Each map has some unique style and can be played differently.\\n\\nSure Mirage has some similarities like Dust 2, but they also established that Mirage's mid is not the same like dust 2 mid. There is clearly inspiration but you can tell it does not play the exact same\\n\\nHaving a map creator allows the community to bring variety of ideas and variety of maps that dont feel like they play the same. We can see new things; new mechanics and new playstyles. I'm sorry but I dont like being claustrophobic with every map I play\\n\\nPlease comment your opinions :)\",\n",

The lore of\\xa0*Valorant* will mostly be delivered through character interaction and environmental elements,\\xa0and\\xa0Nottingham says the team has taken careful consideration to create layered personalities and motivations for all of the characters, which the team *\"can kind of peel back\"* throughout the game\\'s lifetime.\\xa0The type of world-building in *Valorant*, often referred to as environmental storytelling, has been seen previously in similar titles. [*Overwatch*](https://screenrant.com/tag/overwatch/) is a prime example of environmental storytelling, and\\xa0from Nottingham\\'s interview, the similarities between [Blizzard\\'s](https://screenrant.com/tag/blizzard) approach and Riot\\'s storytelling is obvious. On telling stories in this manner, Nottingham says, *\"What\\'s really interesting to me is seeing if that is something that players will engage with, get excited about, or offer their own theories.\"* \\n\\nSo the Lore is being revealed to us with environmental storytelling and by the agents voice lines themselves.

Playing this character, while the other players on your team choose fraggers sucks especially when you lose. Now they are talking about nerfing it? No one in lower ranks is ever going to play this character, peoples egos are too big and they care more about their kills than winning. Which is one of the things that turns me off the most about lower ranks. The amount of times I heal someone to win a game is insane, and when we lose I get demoted for playing a support role because I didn't get as many kills as Reyna who I healed fifteen times during the match.

       "   'selftext': '\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayed a game tonight that had a Sage griefing throughout the entire 13 rounds.   Even at character selection, he kept saying \"dodge or lose guys, dodge or lose. I\\'m telling you now. Dodge this game. Or lose a rank.\" And initially we didn\\'t understand what he was trying to say (he was Platinum 1) while the rest of us were gold/silver/plat. We asked him what he meant and he just said \"Dodge this game. Or lose. you\\'ll find out soon enough.\" But we still picked (because that\\'s what any normal player would do right?) and he said \"Alright you guys wanna lose then lets go\". \\n\\nSo throughout all 13 rounds he would do the following to throw the round: \\n\\n\\\\-wall block when we were advancing or trying to push  \\n\\\\-ice the floor to prevent us from falling back when we were being rushed/give away our position  \\n\\\\-wall block to corner us into a specific space when the enemy was pushing  \\n\\\\-stand directly infront of us in teamfights to block our view  \\n\\\\-stand in front of us when we were holding sites  \\n\\\\-type in all chat and tell the enemy team all our positions and trap placements  \\n\\\\-fire his gun at us to give off our positions to the enemy  \\n\\n\\nAt first we were just really confused - on our team we had a Jett and an Omen who were really good and were getting good picks - but we would lose the match after he would start his wallblocks or just tell the enemy team where we were and how much HP we had left. After awhile we realised that he was determined to grief until we lost the match. \\n\\nTowards the end of the 12/13th round we were so frustrated and confused we asked him to explain to us genuinely why he was doing it, and he said that he was throwing games to get his account banned. He wanted to ban himself from playing Valorant so that he wouldn\\'t keep trying to grind to increase his rank. **He also said he had already thrown the last 14-15 games and he still hadn\\'t been banned yet.** \\n\\nWe asked him how he felt about ruining the games for the many other players in the previous matches  - just to satisfy his want to get himself banned - and he said \"**I don\\'t give a fuck about what other players think or feel, you\\'re nothing to me**\". \\n\\nSo his theory was that instead of just not playing Valorant (to prevent grinding) - he was going to ruin every game he was in to try and get himself banned, while spoiling the ranked game experience for hundreds of other players just trying to have fun. \\n\\nAll of us reported him - but it seems like nothing is being done to stop this kind of behaviour. I\\'ve read a couple of other posts here about people griefing in games but not sure if there\\'s been punishments meted out at all. We had a strong team and we had a good chance to win if it wasn\\'t for the griefer. \\n\\nSorry for the long read - I just wanted to share my horrible experience with youall and hope that something can be done about these players ruining games for others.',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Valorant is a brand new game with a huge dev team. Riot knew the tech they were investing in when it came to Anti-cheat, network infrastructure, etc. would be expensive to keep running while maintaining a development team of over 100 people.\\n\\nIf skin prices were priced comparable to other free-to-play games, eventually, Riot would be forced to shrink the dev team and resources being put aside for this game to compensate. Expensive skins mean that the game can stay free-to-play while maintaining a premium development team.\\n\\nI hear you asking why LoL's skins are cheaper and LoL is still F2P. Simple, LoL has tenfold the player base of Valorant and countless characters all with multiple skins, has the LCS, LEC, and LCK that all have insane advertising costs for partners and buy ons for teams, and many more revenue streams.\\n\\n\\nThese skins are expensive to keep the game F2P and will mean Riot won't have to franchise esports to create income for the game. If you can't afford these skins or can't justify paying that much for them, that's cool, you don't have to buy them, the others that do are making up the money needed to keep the game running.\\n\\nI don't see these prices as greed, I see them as Riot wanting to keep this game AND its competitive scene as accessible as possible while maintaining the dev team. They were most likely told when pitching Valorant that they can do it with an initial budget, but have no access to LoL's revenue for additional resources. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhatever, call me a Riot shill if you want, it's just business at the end of the day and Riot has expenses they need to pay.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Expensive skins pay for big dev team and near-experimental tech for Anti-cheat and netcode\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Step 1: change her E ability to do exactly 1000 damage if you land the Grenade on their head. Now it must balance on their head for a solid 3 seconds, or else the Grenade can’t suck up the opponents brain waves and do said damage. Also make it explode into 4 other pieces which will leave the rest of her team at 1 health.\\n\\nStep 2: give her the ability to fly. I mean come on, raze already can move faster than Jett, just let her fly instead of having satchels ffs. Activating this ability will let her zoom around in the air faster than a Karen marching towards the cashier after receiving a pizza that was undercooked for .1 seconds. This ability will last for as long as you don’t hit a wall or a teammate. Kachow.\\n\\nStep 3: make her boom bot turn invisible when you deploy it. Come on guys. Shooting the boom bot before it blows up? Not cool. That’s like blue balling the poor thing. It just wants to release all its pent up energy, what better way to do that then to make the enemy not be able to see it! It also won’t make noise, because ya know, not every player is deaf. \\n\\nStep 4: change her ultimate so that it’s a hitscan. I mean comeeee onnn, this was the biggest disappointment. Watching your enemies start to run away after hearing her screech “FIRE iN thE HOLE” is no fun at all. You want to give them a quick, painless death. Actually, nah you want it to drag on just a little bit. Leave em at 1 health and make em not able to move for 1 minute. That way you can do whatever you want to em for that minute. Spank em, eat their hair, or if they have the dragon skins, well, ya know the drill ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Hey everyone. Before I get into writing this, I want to make it clear that I understand why skins are as expensive as they are at the top end. Riot's art and skins teams are talented and deserves to make money for their work, and the potential for the kinds of interesting skins they can make has been made abundantly clear by how imaginative the Elderflame skins are. The current price of skins on the shop \\\\*is not a problem\\\\*. Yes, they are expensive. Yes, that is frustrating. There's a ton of skins in this game that I want too! I totally understand and empathize with all of these concerns. Skins are a luxury item and are not necessary for gameplay though, so I understand pricing them accordingly.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat Riot seems to be missing is that, as well as luxury items, skins are a reward for engaging with the game via the battle pass, but they are not treated as such. Battle Pass skins \\\\*need\\\\* to stop being thought of as a luxury item, and need to be seen as a means to get players to engage with your game in the long-term. And, as is, the battle pass is not a reward. It's a slog. I don't need 5 or 6 vandal skins that I really like, I ultimately only need one. But the odds of a battle pass skin being my endgame when the first example of the highest tier of cosmetics we've seen is a literal moving, animated, fire-breathing dragon. Say what you will about whether or not you're a fan of the actual aesthetics, that's inspired, and the skin team did a good job. But the battle pass skins will never fill that kind of need. That's not what they're in the game for. They're neat, and supposed to provide a moderately exciting reward that, in aggregate, feels more valuable than the $10 the player put in, while also rewarding players that \\\\*do\\\\* care about having cool looking guns in a game they put a lot of time into.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs is, none of this happens. The player puts $10 and 100+ hours into a game for the ability to get maybe 2-3 skins they like, and a knife that will be obviated at some point by another knife in some other skin collection down the line, and eventually the rewards from the battle pass will no longer be as exciting, and therefore no longer be worth buying into. But by reducing the time investment down so players feel excited to unlock more items that they can switch between. The store should be aspirational for players, you should want them to be excited by guns that evoke something in them. The battle pass skins should be, in the short term, for players that want access to skins to make them feel more invested in the game, but the long-term reward of the battle pass should be choice. As is, the battle pass doesn't reward me with choice, it's a chore. I love this game and I want to play it for a while, and I want to buy the battle pass again next episode, but I've struggled to complete the battle pass for this episode \\\\*and\\\\* I'm in quarantine. I'm going to complete it, I'm not worried about that, but what I am worried about is my motivation to buy and complete more battle passes in the future.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: The way Riot thinks about the battle pass is out of wack, and battle pass skins need to be thought of as fundamentally different in function than shop skins. By fixing this issue and making the battle pass reward players for time spent in the game better, they incentivize people actually buying the battle pass more than once or twice to get skins for the guns they don't care about. The battle pass needs to exist to excite players about having multiple skins worth switching between long-term and maintain player engagement, but the objective of the battle pass as it stands right now is incredibly short sighted and basically serves as another avenue to turn a profit, but since it's redundant with the shop players are less interested in buying into either one because both feel over costed.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I'm currently Diamond 2 and before saying that I'm low rank and I don't know what I'm talking about let me explain... I usually play with my girlfriend and my friends and they are in gold 2 to plat 1 and that makes me play with even more low ranks than me what makes me incredible hard to rank up but going to the topic, this last 2 weeks my friends and I didn't had schedule to play together so in most of the time I only played with my girlfriend. After some wins and loses I started noticing that most of the people don't know how to enter a site and because the game has so many abilities that they spend the entire round throwing random things to the air thinking they are making the difference. On the contrary people when defending a site they leave and rush because they use all of their things in the beginning and get bored of waiting or holding a angle. Now I know people are gonna judge me because me as Diamond can't carry plat / gold games but as you know this is a team game and if only 2 people don't know how to enter a site the game is 10 times harder. I just want to ask what to do in this situation? Should I try to tell them what to do? Should I just keep quiet and lose the game? I really can't find a way to deal with this type of people.\\n\\n**For the people who didn't understand the title because I was too lazy to explain this is the explanation...**\\n\\nWhen you're new to a game you don't know nothing and you'll probably do what the guy first in the scoreboard is saying without even questioning him, after a while you start to get decent enough to see yourself ranking up and being the first guy in the scoreboard, then in most fps games you reach a breaking point that you don't rank up more if you don't how to play as a team and people start studying more macro because your aim isn't all you need. After that breaking point ( In my opinion is plat / Diamond ) some people will think they already know how to play the game and they will ignore you and if you complain they will troll the game. Now hear me out, If you teach the player some basic mechanics of the game like entering a site, defend a site etc while they are on the first stage of learning the game, people would learn that basic stuff and the games would feel more competitive and it wouldn't exist such a gap in skill inside each rank. I feel that some Gold / Plat players are really good and other are terrible and the terrible ones make the good players have a hard time to rank up even if their skill level is too high for Gold or Plat.\\n\\nSorry if the text is full of gramatical errors English isn't my main language.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hi all,\\n\\nlet me preface this with saying: I get we all play for fun and the vast majority of us are not aiming to become pro players, are not content creators or streamers.\\n\\nMeans: we spend time with this game in our free time to enjoy ourselves, have fun with friends and give our brain some rest from daily routines.\\n\\nThat being said, bypassing a system in place that exists to maintain competitive integrity, in order to maximise the fun for you and your friends is so wrong on so many levels and might generate fun in the short term, but in the long term, it will ruin the fun for everyone, including you and your friends.\\n\\nGranted, one could say it\\'s RIOTs job to make sure their systems in placed are not getting bypassed. They went above and beyond with Vanguard in order to make it as hard as possible for cheaters to ruin matches for the rest of us and this is a good thing. \\n\\nAt the same time, there seems to be ZERO repercussions for smurfing which imho is an issues they need to deal with fast.\\n\\nI massively enjoyed the game in the beta and after ranked mode started I massively enjoyed it again.\\n\\nRanks were a bit messy at first, but once people reached their ELOs, matches were a blast, even more so after the changes to the overtime system, which made the matches feel a lot more competitive and less coin-flippy.\\n\\nThe sad thing is, ever since last week, there wasn\\'t even a single match where the overtime system even would have been needed, since so many matches were massive stomps for one team or the other and in a competitive environment, this **IS** a problem.\\n\\nI personally started to see the match quality go down the drain once people had started to finish their battle passes. \\n\\nIt felt like after people were done with those, there was not much incentive left to stick with their mains and smurfs started to become more common.\\n\\nHere is a screenshot of my last 9 matches played: [click](https://imgur.com/6EfZjxB) ...out of those 9 matches, two were more or less close with 13-9 and 13-10, two more were less close with 13-5 and 13-6 ...five were stomps for one team or the other where the losing team could not net more than 4 rounds.\\n\\nAnd the vast majority of those matches, it was smurfs ruining the match. Be it the 3 stack that is on a deranking mission or the lowest rank in one team single handly dominating the whole enemy team and watching him play makes it rather obvious that it is in fact not a bronze, silver or gold player, but a higher ranked player playing on a low rank account.\\n\\nThe problem is that smurfs not only ruin the matches they are in, they also will ruin a lot more matches after.\\n\\n* they might need/ want to derank again at some point\\n\\n* their boosted friends might join the solo queue again at some point and then will not be able to perform at the level they got boosted to\\n\\n* which then (along with other things) will increase distrust in other players and the MM system in itself\\n\\n* it will increaste toxicity and tilt overall because everyone is frustrated and \"on the edge\"\\n\\n* the more people have the matches ruined, the more likely they are to make smurfs themselves, maybe just to throw, maybe just to chill\\n\\n\\nOverall, actual consistency in the ladder will be less and less, you will not be able to trust your teammates, the enemy and the MM system in the first place, ranked mode will turn into a glorified quickplay mode where a lot of people don\\'t even care anymore, but join anyways because it still is \"better\" than unrated.\\n\\nMy point is: it just will get worse from here and in the end a lot of people will have their matches ruined for one reason or another.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen it happening in OW and I got mocked and downvoted, same like here. The last time I played OW I had matches where I often was the only one in the lobby playing on an actual main account and OW is not even a free to play game, the problem here will be tenfold worse when not addressed and contained soon.\\n\\nWe all are here to have fun, Valorant is a great game, let\\'s keep it like that. Stop ruining  the game over short-term fun with your friends that might benefit you and your group now, but just will create problems for everyone, **including you and your friends**, in the long run.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So you want to play sage? Here are some tips and tricks from me, a professional Valorant player. I have played valorant for 5 minutes, and I read one page on the wiki, so you know you\\'re in safe hands.\\n\\n1: When playing sage, NEVER HEAL TEAMMATES. While this may seem silly as sage is the only healer, you must keep yourself alive so that you can heal yourself in the future. As a result, you should never heal anyone but yourself, even if you have 97 HP and your ally has 12 HP.\\n\\n2: If your teammates force you to heal them, make sure to never move towards your teammates. Politely ask them to walk across the entire map with low health and walk through enemy territory. This will make them feel more powerful and confident if they manage to reach you safely and receive healing.\\n\\n3: Try to remain at spawn, and never move. This is because sage is considered a \"sentinel\" by the game. A sentinel is a soldier whose job is to stand and keep watch. The game designers have called sage a sentinel to hint at the playstyle of staying in spawn, which drastically reduces your chances of death. By defending spawn, you can make sure that the enemies don\\'t take control of your most valuable position which is closely connected to the sites on a map.\\n\\n4: When attacking as sage, try to wall off your path to the site and use slow orbs to slow your team. This will encourage your team to play more slowly and methodically, as they can no longer rush a site.\\n\\n5: When defending as sage, try to wall off your teammates in corners, such that they cannot see the site or move. Your teammates with thank you for this, as they can no longer be attacked by the enemies while your wall still stands. Additionally, try to place slow orbs at the feet of your teammates so they move slowly and fire more accurately.\\n\\n6: When defending a site post plant, make sure to wall yourself into a corner so that you cannot see the spike. This will allow the defenders to defuse the spike, saving you and your teammates from dying in the spike\\'s explosion\\n\\n7: When retaking a site, make sure to throw slow orbs randomly into the site to reveal your position. If you throw a slow orb at your feet, your enemies will be stunned by your genius tactics and will allow you to defuse the spike for free.\\n\\n8: When using your ultimate, always resurrect teammates in enemy fire, so that they can see where the enemies are while being revived. Never wall off your resurrection target from the enemies, as you will have to push in afterwards and the wall will hinder you.\\n\\n\\nThese were some of the best tips and tricks you can use as a sage main. Remember, while your teammates might get angry at you, you\\'re doing this for their good by teaching them better practices.\\n\\nSo start now, and in no time you\\'ll reach the coveted rank of iron 1.',\n",

I'm wondering what you all have noticed?\\n\\nThe first advantage goes to the average solo players, this makes sense because it's the majority of the player base.\\n\\nThe next advantage goes to teams who are boosting players, the better players on the team are stuck in a rank too low because they hardly get MMR while boosting, while giving the enemy an equally low rated player who is always extremely difficult to carry. This is a horrible decision, if the rank difference is too great the party should require a full team and the weight of MMR should go in favor of the enemy, instead of trying to find a balanced match. If I have diamond  and plats on my team I shouldn't be getting a random silver because the enemy has a silver.  \\n\\n\\nThe next advantage seems to go for parties of 2, it's usually all solo players and other teams of 2.\\n\\nThere are no more advantages after that.\\n\\nParties of 5 tend to go up against smaller teams of much higher ranked players, on average a full division higher per player.\\n\\nTeams of 4 you almost always get the boosted player from the second listed advantage team who thought it would be a good idea to play solo.\\n\\nAnd I don't know what is about teams of 3 but the matches are always super easy or super hard. I just want balance.\\n\\nIMO parties of 2 &amp; 3(when their ranks are similar) as well as solos should all have the same MMR weight distribution. MMR should also stop trying to put the highest MMR player with the lowest MMR players,  this doesn't create balance it keeps bad players &amp; good players in ranks they don't belong in.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Over the past week I\\'ve seen a lot of posts on here and /r/ValorantCompetitive talking about the frustrations of climbing and the ranked system with screenshots of their match MVPs and history. While the ranked system clearly has flaws it\\'s not the main issue here.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking as someone who is currently D3 in Val, has 2-3k hours of CS:GO (SMFC peak), 4k+ hours of LoL (D3 peak), and many hours of other competitive games let me tell you a few important things so that you can avoid the pitfalls I\\'ve made.\\n\\n\\n1. **Most important** - *This is not an RPG.* Grinding in this game (unless you are already way above the skill level of your rank) is absolutely pointless and just because you play a lot does not mean you should be consistently progressing and ranking up. I\\'ve played League since season 1 constantly trying to \"grind\" to gold, then plat then diamond. I yelled at my teammates, I blamed matchmaking when in reality I just wasn\\'t that good. This poor mindset made it so that I was stuck at the same rank for YEARS with multiple chat bans.\\n\\n2. Dropping 20+ kills a game in gold and getting Match MVP means absolutely nothing. If you are winning or losing games where you get Match/Team MVP with 20 kills and the game goes 13-7 that means you\\'re averaging 1 kill per round. This doesn\\'t even take into consideration having low impact kills in rounds you lose like getting two exit kills on a lost round which will inflate your kda. \\n\\n3. This should seem pretty obvious but winning against people who have lower ranks than you in close games (13-11), is going to give you almost no gains. It just shows that you are at the appropriate level, and that\\'s okay! To give you another perspective I \"grinded\" to diamond in Riot\\'s Team Fight Tactics. Only the top 4 of 8 players in a game are guaranteed elo gains. But the difference between 1st and 4th is astronomical. 1st may get you anywhere between 30-50lp (out of 100) where 4th may sometimes get you 8lp. Winning is important but it\\'s a lot about how you win.\\n\\n\\nIf you play to actively get better and be a tier above what your rank is now, instead of trying to grind your way up, you will eventually get a higher rank. But getting better is more than just playing Valorant. You need to review your games and how YOU played (not your teammates). You should compare how you play to professional players to see what you\\'re doing wrong. You can work on getting your aim more consistent through aim trainers if you find you are constantly over or undershooting your targets.\\n\\n\\nThis leads into another important topic:\\n\\n* Posting clips on this subreddit of your best performing round and asking what you can do to improve does absolutely nothing for you and this subreddit. It\\'s just another way to pass the blame and it is extremely transparent.\\n\\nYou are not as good as you think you are... but you can be! You can be better, you can improve! But that should be the goal. Not to play more so that the rank you think you deserve shows up on your screen.\\n\\nI don\\'t think my post will stop all the complaining on the valorant subs but I do think it might help some people realize that the game isn\\'t against them and sometimes we need to own up to how things are. I do hope this helps some people',\n",

This is very apparent when it comes to clutch situations on the attacker side.\\n\\nFor example, if you\\'re in a 1vX situation with the bomb planted (X being 2 or more people), you need to equalize the situation by creating 1v1 duels that you can take. Unless you\\'re playing a character with some sort of special utility that can delay defuses safely (i.e. Brimstone), you\\'re not going to be able to realistically play the bomb even in a 1v2. This is because one guy can just stick the bomb and the second guy can either hunt for you or hold a weird off angle where you can be, so if you peek out and try to jiggle/kill the defuser, you\\'ll die to the off angle guy. This is even more true when you\\'re in a 1vX against utility heavy opponents that can molotov you out or wall/smoke off several areas where you could be at, forcing you into an even more unfavorable situation. \\n\\nMany many times I\\'ll see a guy just hide behind a box and do absolutely nothing while he either gets swung on two sides, or he\\'ll end up trying to peek the bomb defuser too late and just die to another guy holding an angle. \\n\\nThere are times when playing passive in this scenario could work, such as if you know the rotation is extremely slow and the bomb timer is already almost gone, you probably could play passively. \\n\\nIn non-clutch situations where there\\'s a man disadvantage, you have to also find opportunities to equalize the situation so you can get back into the round. For example, if you\\'re defender side and your team in the round is 3v5, you\\'re probably not going to win the round if you just hold passively. If you\\'re \"offered\" a free 1v1 fight that you think is reasonably winnable, you should probably take that fight to equalize the numbers somewhat so that your team has a better shot at winning the round. This is also why you see some players walk push out of their site on defender when there isn\\'t info being given, or if someone on their team died but an execute isn\\'t happening on the site that the teammate got picked off on. \\n\\nThis is an extremely well-understood concept in games like CS:GO, and I feel like it applies enough here that you guys would be able to take away from and directly apply to Valorant. Let me know what you guys think.',\n",

So naturally, the enemy team started complaining about how boring the game is because of trolls like them. Then my team decided to make the game more interesting and fun for them so we agreed to kill their sage with guns then drop our guns for a knife only fight. They were down for it and it led to the most fun me and my friends had in the game ever. We did a few normal knife fights which was already pretty fun, then a hide and seek round, then we decided to take a group pic with cypher cam to save the moment. We brought it all the way to round 12 where we did a 1v1 gauntlet knife only. We ended up exchanging discords to share the cypher cam pic with them later on.   \\n\\n\\nI love this part of the community &lt;3 (shoutouts to all the Thai gamers out there, yall rock )  \\n\\n\\n[Group Photo](https://imgur.com/a/ZIO6Gus)\",\n",

I haven't been playing Valorant lately, but I was Diamond before taking a break, and I've noticed something in a lot of the low rank clips on here. When people are smoking out lines of sight as Brimstone or Omen, they're not really worrying about where exactly their smoke lands, as long as it covers the doorway/whatever it is. This isn't how you should smoke. If possible, line your smoke up so that ~85-90% of the smoke is inside the enemy's side of the doorway. Don't just smack it right in the middle of the doorway. The reason for this is that if you give the enemy too much room to maneuver on your side of the smoke, it's easier for them to push through without being exposed to multiple lines of sight. If your side of the smoke is roughly flush with the entryway, however, the instant they try to come through the smoke they're going to be exposed to multiple lines of sight, and have no cover to play around. \\n\\nTL;DR Make the side of your smoke which is visible to your team flush with the entry point you're smoking, so the enemy has no cover to play with if they're pushing through the smoke.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': '**The Obvious:**\\n\\n* The Vandal: A modern AK variant (duh). One key difference between IRL AK\\'s and the Vandal is the Vandal\\'s  charging handle (what you pull to \"cock\" the gun) is found on the left side instead of the right. The AK is sort of known for having its charging handle on the right, so just a thought.\\n* The Phantom: The Phantom is a carbon-copy suppressed SCAR-L variant\\n*  The Guardian: Definitely is a futurized M1 Garand. However, three key differences exist. The magazine is reloaded from the bottom, like modern firearms, instead of the Garand\\'s signature 8 round stripper clip. The magazine is larger, carrying 12 rounds instead of 8. There is also a modern pistol-style grip on the Guardian, a trait found in nearly all modern firearms. \\n* The Classic: It seems is a slightly futurized FN-9 handgun, judging from its distinctive grip. \\n* The Shorty: Just your typical hill-billy sawed-off double-barreled shotgun.\\n* The Judge: Everyone\\'s love/hate relationship is a futurized AA-12 full-auto shotgun, with a drum mag that for some reason, only hold 7 shells.  The drum mag in real life can hold up to 32 shells! So either the Judge is using a 7 round drum mag (which is stupid, as drum mags have a tendency to have feeding issues, just use a normal mag!), or firing really really large shells. \\n* The Sheriff: Just your typical six-shooter revolver chambered in a high caliber. Maybe .308\\n* The Marshall: This is just your typical cowboy Western lever action rifle with a scope mounted on it.  Maybe a Remington model. \\n* The Bulldog: Definitely is an AUG variant. (fun fact, it\\'s named the Bulldog because it\\'s a bullpup assault rifle, which means the magazine and firing system is located behind the grip. Bullpup? Bulldog? Get it?)\\n* The Bucky: This shotgun is a most likely a shorter version of the M870 Remington pump-action shotgun\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Not-So Obvious**\\n\\nHere is where we can see Riot start to either mix guns together or simply insert their own unique guns:\\n\\n* The Ghost: The Ghost may seem like a USP-S to CS:GO players, but its actually not not. It\\'s much sleeker, with a lower profile than the USP pistol. If I had to guess, it\\'s a futurized Walther P38, with a super thick trigger guard as a touch from Riot\\'s design team. \\n* The Frenzy: This pistol looks nothing like the CZ-75, despite CS:GO players calling the Frenzy Riot\\'s knockoff CZ. This pistol accepts it\\'s magazine in front of the grip, a feature found in the Tec-9. However, the Frenzy obviously does not look like a Tec-9, so its probably a fusion of whatever normal pistol and the Tec, with Riot\\'s own unique touches added. \\n* The Stinger: This SMG is most likely a fusion of the UMP SMG and the CZ Scorpion Evo 3. The stock, grip, bolt, reciever and magazines match the UMP, while the barrel shroud matches the CZ Scorpion. The Stinger also inherits the Scorpions extremely fast rate of fire, clocking in at 1080 rounds per minute. Not as fast as the Scorpion IRL but that\\'s damn fast. \\n\\n**On a side note, Riot, WHY ARE YOUR RATE OF FIRE STATS LISTED IN ROUNDS PER SECOND? USE ROUNDS PER MINUTE LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE GODDAMIT!**\\n\\nOk, back to business. \\n\\n* The Spectre: The gun seems to be a fusion of the famous MP5 and the M16 family of rifles. The barrel, grip, and signature curved 30 round magazine all match the MP5\\'s charcteristics. It even has the MP5\\'s famous telescoping stock, which your character pulls out when he/she equips the weapon. However, the Spectre does not have the MP5 firing system, instead possessing the M16 family\\'s firing system where the charging handle is found in the form of a bolt found behind the rear sights of the gun. \\n* The Operator: The Op seems to be a fusion of two .50 caliber sniper rifles: The Macmillan Tac-50 and the Barrett M82 sniper. The Operator possess the Tac-50\\'s bolt action system with a bit of futuristic details, while also possessing the Barrett\\'s magazine capacity (5 rounds), receiver, and barrel. The Operator, judging from its disticntive boom, and the size of the bullets, fires a similar .50 BMG cartridge. What does that mean? Your character\\'s shoulders should be fucking broken after firing this gun multiple times, let alone even once. .50 cal sniper are designed to be fired from a mounted/prone position because .50 cal rounds are super powerful.  \\n* The Ares: I can\\'t think of any guns that the Ares is modeled off of at the moment, so I\\'ll just say that Riot designed their own gun. Seems like your typical SAW (squad automatic weapon) that you would give to the support guy in your squad. It even comes with a bipod.\\n* The Odin: The Odin is probably of Riot\\'s own design, I can\\'t think of any other HMG\\'s that look similar to this in any way at the moment. However, judging from the size of the cartridges in the belt, it fires .50 caliber rounds. Which makes no goddamn sense, given the Odin\\'s fire rate. .50 caliber machine guns and automatic weapons of higher calibers are mounted for a reason. The most famous .50 cal machine gun, the M2 Browning, has a pretty slow rate of fire at 400-500 RPM unless mounted on aircraft, and that\\'s for good reason. There\\'s no feasible way to shoot bullets of that power grade accurately at high fire rates on the ground, even when mounted. The Odin has near double that fire rate, at 936 RPM at max ramp. Only 2-3 Operator shots can hurt you severely when firing from your shoulder. Now imagine what will happen if you just fire hundreds of Operator shots at 936 rounds per minute.  Ah well. Video game it is.\\n* Knife: The Knife seems to be just a knife of Riot\\'s own design. A blade with a molded grip, a serrated back edge, and blade shape that reminds me of the US KA-BAR.  Knife\\'s a knife!',\n",

       "   'selftext': '#  The Training Issue in Valorant\\n\\nHey guys, back again with another lengthy post that the majority of you probably won\\'t be bothered to read through! Let me begin by saying that I believe Valorant has tons of potential as a competitive tac shooter, and I have been enjoying the game greatly, which is why I believe it would be wrong to overlook some of the glaring issues that could easily be improved upon. We all know that there are server-side issues in this game in the form of peeker\\'s advantage, hit registration, etc. but I\\'m certain that the dev team is very aware of these problems and is actively working on fixing them, so I won\\'t focus on them in this post. The issue I am concerned about and interested in raising awareness about in this post, is the lack of in-game training provisions. As a coach, it is quite disappointing that every time I\\'m creating a training routine for someone, I have to find maps on Kovaak\\'s that compensate for the lack of an in-game deathmatch, or a decently structured firing range, or a proper bomb site retake emulator ( no spike defuse in the range doesn\\'t count ). The lack of such fundamental ways to train in-game is a huge detriment to the individual improvement of players, especially in the aspect of mechanics. While training your aim through aim trainers is also necessary to address more specific weaknesses which are related to raw aim, there are certain mechanics ( crosshair placement, spraying patterns, movement, etc. ) which it is better to work on through in-game provisions. The top aimers in CSGO came long before FPS aim trainers were mainstream, and the way they achieved their top tier skill level in aiming was through playing hours and hours of Free for all deathmatch.\\n\\n# The Solution\\n\\nIn CSGO, the base game\\'s resources in terms of maps that allow you to train fundamental mechanics are pretty lackluster as well, instead, the workshop allows players to create their own maps / gamemodes etc. which leads to a diversified pool of resources which allows players to browse through hundreds of thousands of player created content in order to find what they\\'re looking for; Since the Valorant dev team doesn\\'t seem too inclined to adding a workshop or custom game browser to Valorant ( keep in mind how long it took for Overwatch to introduce such a feature ), for which they probably have valid reasons, here are a couple of improvements / additions that could be made to the current game structure that I believe would be highly beneficial to the playerbase.\\n\\n***Firing Range:***\\n\\n* Add the ability for players to customize the range further, allow players to set the amount of target dummies that spawn on the map, ( Too many dummies = not enough range between each dummy to allow proper target-switching practice ) Allow players to set the model movement speed and strafe interval ( how often dummies switch direction ) for moving dummies, allow players to spawn peek walls to practice strafe peeking and wallbanging, and finally allow the dummies to spawn in a wider area.\\n\\n***Spike Defuse:***\\n\\n* Spike defuse is a great recreation of CSGO retake servers, but with AI replacing actual players. If done properly, this gamemode found within the practice range, could be one of the most beneficial forms of in-game training. Spike defuse allows you to actively train your ability to clear angles, position your crosshair properly, and peek into bomb sites. This gamemode ( in theory ) could be the best form of specifically training your ability to retake sites post-plant. In CSGO, there are maps called \"Prefire &gt;insert map name&lt;\" found on the workshop that do this perfectly, you choose a map, select the bomb site you want to practice retaking, and then select the difficulty of the bots, the amount of bots, and your weapon / armor tier of choice. The bots spawn in realistic positions, that real players would hold in a live game scenario, and the spawn positions are randomized each time you die or the run is reset ( manually or through killing all targets ). If the Spike defuse mode in Valorant could evolve into a mode which allows us to choose the map, bomb site, and amount of bots / difficulty of bots that spawn, this could be huge in helping players improve. The gamemode is currently far too repetitive, lacks variety and customization, and isn\\'t even part of an actual map in the game.\\n\\n***Deathmatch:***\\n\\n* Finally, a very obvious addition much desired by the Valorant community is the implementation of a deathmatch gamemode. The gamemode doesn\\'t need to be too in-depth, simply allow random spawns with an algorithm that stops people from spawning too near to others, a set score limit, and a server member cap of 10 - 15 players. Abilities should be disabled in this game mode, as it\\'s meant to be a form of training your gunplay and movement, not your utility usage. Deathmatch should be \"Free for all\" as it allows much more fluid and continuous combat, and is better suited for variable spawn rates. A Deathmatch feature would be a great way to train in-game gunplay fundamentals such as crosshair placement, peeking / holding angles, and combat related movement, in a much more fluid nature than simply playing unrated matches over and over again. The biggest issue with playing unrated to improve your mechanics is that there are massive amounts of down-time where you\\'re not really doing much, an FFA deathmatch allows you to constantly be in combat, so 20 minutes of FFA = 20 minutes of active combat, whereas a 1 hour long unrated game realistically results in something closer to 15 minutes of added combat, so you\\'re wasting 4 times the time, for the same return ( which is probably not even true, since in actual matches you have much more to focus on in combat than just movement / aim ).\\n\\n***Hopefully anyone from the Valorant dev team notices this post, although I highly doubt it, it would be great to have any sort of back and forth with someone working on the game.

       "   'selftext': 'So yesterday, I hopped on Valorant with my (very skilled FPS player) boyfriend to play a few unrated games. I\\'m obsessed with Valorant. I\\'ve never played an FPS before but I\\'m having a blast even though my performance is pretty inconsistent currently. Some games I\\'m top frag or in the middle of my team and others I barely get a kill (I think it has more to do with me psyching myself out more than anything AND still learning how to move well.) Yesterday, one of the games we played, I had 0 kills by like 13 rounds. It was making me doubt myself so hard which just made my performance worse and worse. Suddenly, a teammate said \"hey guys let\\'s help Reyna get a kill\" and so they did. They moved forward and told me to stay towards the back and really tried hard to help me get one. Still didn\\'t happen. A couple rounds later, I got my first kill of the game and not only did my entire team cheer me on but the opposing team did as well. I ended up getting 2 more kills that game and they did nothing but support me and hype me up. It made me enjoy the game that much more and then I went on to play a couple games that night where I was top fragging. Sometimes the Valorant community can really get me down but man, that was awesome and I hope someone from that game reads this, recognizes my username, and continues to do that in future games where a teammate is severely under performing. You have no idea how happy/supported that made me feel.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Ok, this might be dumb, but I think I\\'m on to something. I think Valorant is in need of a game mode that is more than just a CS:GO rip and Spike Rush ain\\'t it. People have suggested generic things like a deathmatch and other practice modes, but honestly why settle for something so unimaginative? Fortnite\\'s Battle Royale wasn\\'t their main game mode, but ended up being more popular than their main game. So I was thinking, what would be a great game mode idea? and then it hit me: bed wars.  No no don\\'t click off, hear me out. The classic Minecraft PvP game mode was popular for a reason. It featured 4 teams fighting to control points and protect their bases something that no shooter has attempted since. But how, you ask would this work for Valorant? It would need a new map. However, it would fit the Valorant aesthetic. The fractured floating islands fit with the theme of Ascent and would be wonderful for a Bed Wars style game mode. The game mode could be called Spike Wars and here\\'s how it would go down. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1st all players spawn on their island corner of the map 4 teams of 5. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAll players spawn in with a classic and collect credits from the forge at their base and at control points in the surrounding area in order to purchase gun upgrades, ammo, armor and buffs. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere are control points in the center of the map as well as other contested points that players can attempt to hold in exchange for various rewards. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWith enough credits a team can forge a \"spike\" this can be planted in the opposing team\\'s base and when planted the opposing team no longer respawns. If the spike can be defused players will once again respawn. However, if the team dies with a spike planted they will be eliminated. A Spike can also be planted at the center of the map and if defended successfully it will explode winning the game for the team that planted it. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs the game goes on, respawns are made longer and longer until a sudden death is activated at the end of the round where all teams lose their ability to respawn.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Some of you may have read my guide on how to play sage. Since no one requested it, I shall make a guide on Phoenix.\\n\\nAs some of you may already know, I have played phoenix for 5 minutes in the range, so I think it\\'s safe to say I\\'m pretty experienced.\\n\\nHere are some of the top tips and tricks you can use to become the next pablo.gonzales2007\\n\\n1: When playing phoenix, always use your curveball to flash your teammates. Their screens will become bright for a second or two. Use this to help sleepy players stay awake. Your teammates are sure to thank you for your service.\\n\\n2: You can use your hot hands and blaze wall to heal yourself, so make sure to use these on your teammates as well. Your teammates won\\'t be able to heal, but they will appreciate the gesture and team morale will increase drastically.\\n\\n3: If you need to use your hot hands ability to heal yourself, make sure to throw the fire into a corner where your teammates with low health are standing, and run into the corner so that your teammate is trapped and cannot escape. The enemies will think that there is no one hidden in the corner because of the damage usually inflicted by the ability, and they will proceed to walk past the corner without checking it. If the enemies happen to push within 5 seconds before your teammate succumbs to the flames, your ally will be able to secure a kill, and your team will win the round. This is a popular deception tactic used in high level wood 3 matches.\\n\\n4: Try using your blaze wall to wall off your line of sight from the bomb site, so that you are protected from enemy fire. Ideally, you would hide 4 allies and yourself behind this wall in a corner, so that your teammates are safe from fire.\\n\\n5: If you are ever in direct fire, make sure to use your ultimate ability, Run it Back, to quickly escape. Your enemies will chase after you, and once your ultimate ends, you will return to the place where you started. Your enemies will be baffled by your superior intellect and strategy, and they will instantly call a vote to surrender.\\n\\n6: Phoenix\\'s powers are based around fire, so make sure to flame your teammates when they don\\'t win a 1v5 fight because you ran into enemy fire and died. This will improve team morale, and will help strengthen the tight bond between you and your teammates.\\n\\n7: When attacking as Phoenix, force your supportive agents to enter the site first so they are ready to support you when you enter the site, enabling you to get an ace. If your support agents die when entering the site, make sure to flame them to emphasise the fact that all your powers are based around flames.\\n\\n8: When defending a site as Phoenix, try to equip your curveball and unequip it repeatedly to make lots of noise. This will give away your position, and when the enemies come to kill you, you can shoot them and win the round.\\n\\n9: When retaking a site as Phoenix, try to throw your hot hands ability onto the spike so that your teammates cannot defuse the spike. They will have to wait for you to defuse it, and will acknowledge your superiority\\n\\n10: When defending a site post plant, make sure to run away from the spike immediately after planting it. This enables you to find enemies and kill them, while also keeping you safe if the spike explodes.\\n\\n11: Some players may tell you to practice flicking to targets\\' heads to improve your aim. A good way to practice this is by joining a competitive match and flicking your cursor to the lock in button after selecting Phoenix. This will improve your chances of playing Phoenix, and will make your team happy as they do not have to wait for another person to select their agent, usually saving them 5-10 seconds. Don\\'t forget to spam \"sage pls\" in chat to boost team morale!\\n\\nThese were some of the top tips for Phoenix. Make sure to keep practicing instalocking Phoenix to help your team!',\n",

Sometimes I feel I have to sell a bit of my soul to the valorant gods and let this sick paradox of a game take me through an absolute hell ride of emotions while I’m clinging to the last bit of sanity I have left, just to simply get one kill. Now, granted, I’m an average gold 2 player. But, of course it’s not my skill that’s at fault here (never admit your aim is off). It’s gotta be the game. That’s the only explanation why I would lose 12 games in a row and bottom frag with raze while my teammates shit on me for throwing my nade and only damaging myself (and my self esteem). By the end of the game I’m 4-19 and truly a shell of a human being that I once was before I played Ascent for the 5th time in a row. \\n\\nLong story short, I love this game.

I had shooting bound to keyboard to prevent any unnecessary mouse movement and the result is that:\\n\\nOut of the 20 shots that I took with crosshair perfectly centered over the bots head, only 9 of them counted as headshot. That\\'s 45% accuracy.\\n\\nhttps://gfycat.com/deadbetterjaguar\\n\\nKeep in mind that this is with crosshair perfectly centered, so to chance to miss goes up if your aim is sllightly off. I can imagine that if you aim at the left third of the head hitbox, you will get even worse numbers.\\n\\nThis means that Riot decided that they want to equalize the playing field by replacing a portion of your skill with RNG. No matter how good your aim is, you might still not get the kill and on the other hand thanks to that the guy on the other side, despite not aiming at your head might actually headshot you.\\n\\nWhy does it bother me so much? Because the way Valorant presents itself is \"competitive shooter\" with \"competitive integrity\" as its focus. RNG has no place in any of these and it is my opinion that individual skill should be the deciding factor, not RNG.\\n\\nIt seems Valorant instead tries to blur the lines a bit to make the game more newbie friendly in order to maximize player base. And with the number of skins that are being pushed out, it feels like Valorant tries to be the next Fortnite rather than the next CSGO.',\n",

I assume the last set of weekly missions will give around the same amount of xp, maybe 1k more each. It doesn't really make a difference.\\n\\nThis is the first time I play a game I like with a battlepass system. I thought playing a couple games every day would be more than enough to complete the thing. Oh boy I was wrong.\\n\\nIf you don't play 2 to 3 games a day, **every single day** of the battlepass' length, you won't make it to level 50. Period.\\n\\nHad a long day at work and you want to rest a bit instead of playing? Nope.\\n\\nWant to spend a week-end with your family and friends? Nope.\\n\\nThis is very anti-consumer practice and I don't think it should be the norm. I consider myself lucky because the day the battlepass launched, I noticed there was absolutely no benefit of buying it early on so I didn't buy it yet. But a lot of people did and most of them will fall short of level 50 and will have to make a choice. A tough choice. Give up on the last rewards or spend a little extra VP on the battlepass.\\n\\nThis has been thoroughly calculated and designed by Riot Games for it to end like this. **They are not your friends**, they are trying to squeeze every bit of money they can by playing with your brain. Don't fall for it.\\n\\nMy hope is that for the next battlepass, either Riot Games realize their battlepass model is grindy, and do something about it (which I never expect from them) or that way more people speak with their wallet and don't buy the next battlepass.

       "   'selftext': \"Walking inaccuracy is too low in this game that it doesnt punish players for being caught offguard while moving and not able to properly stop to shoot. I feel like this seriously lowers the games skill ceiling as people don't have to master movement as much as in other games (like CS) and while Valorant is not CS, CS' movement inaccuracy is amazing. If you move even a slight while shooting, your shots won't connect and that is fine. It makes the game less luck based and more skill based where you actually have to learn to stop and shoot in a unison increasing the game's ceiling of skill.  \\n\\n\\nNow to the other thing, first shot inaccuracy. I will never get why guns don't have first shot accuracy in CS and now its a thing in Valorant which absolutely blows. You should award highly precise players rather than making their first shot randomized causing them to miss. Valorant shouldn't be like a dice where you have 1/3 chance of missing a clear headshot and 2/3 chances of hitting it. If my crosshair is on the clearly on the head, it should *clearly* be a headshot. There is no reason to even punish such a shot if the player is accurate. \\n\\nThank you for listening to my rant lol, but these mechanics make the game have more luck based gun mechs rather than skill.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'After making my [guide for phoenix](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hv6s55/tips_and_tricks_to_help_bring_your_phoenix/) and my [guide for sage](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/hul3dn/tips_and_tricks_to_improve_your_sage_gameplay_and/), I have decided to make a guide for omen. This is a highly detailed guide oriented towards players already at plastic 3, so if you aren\\'t at that rank yet, you may have trouble following this guide. \\n\\nI haven\\'t unlocked omen yet, so it\\'s safe to say I am a professional Omen main.\\n\\nThese tips and tricks are highly effective, and will help you reach your desired rank of plastic 1 within a few days.\\n\\n1: Omen is a \"controller\" in Valorant. While inexperienced players might think this means that he has to take map control, they are wrong. \"Controller\" refers to the fact that you can increase your skills greatly by playing omen on an Xbox controller. Using a keyboard and mouse will hinder you from achieving your true potential.\\n\\n2: You can use your paranoia ability to blind enemies and push into a site. A clever way to use this ability is to stand behind your team while entering a site and blinding your entire team. When your teammates cannot see, they will be forced to improvise a strategy which will be far better than your current strategy. Your teammates will thank you for your assistance.\\n\\n3: Your shrouded step ability allows you to teleport short distances. Inexperienced players will use this to cross enemies watching areas and chokepoints with operators. However, this is not a viable strategy  as your enemies will know that you are playing omen and will assume that you have already crossed their sightlines. However, this is incorrect usage of the ability. When you see an enemy, use your shrouded step to teleport behind them. They will be stunned, and you can kill them with your knife to save ammo. This little known strategy is used in professional wood 3 games.\\n\\n4: Your dark cover is an invaluable ability which lets you place rechargeable smokes. One way to use this is to purchase a shorty or bucky, and place a smoke at spawn. Hide inside the smoke, ideally with your entire team, and when enemies come to your spawn you can run outside the smoke and kill them. Don\\'t forget to keep running in circles inside the smoke to give away your position!\\n\\n5: Your ultimate ability \"From the Shadows\" allows you to teleport to any location on the map. Use this to teleport a few feet ahead of your teammates so that you can reach the site first and win the marathon. Remember, Valorant is not a game about teamwork and coordination to plant the spike, it is a marathon where you must run into the site as fast as possible to win the race.\\n\\n6: When attacking a site, make sure to smoke off your entrance to the site. Your enemies will not expect you to come from that entrance, and you can surprise them by walking through the smoke and killing them. After taking control, don\\'t forget to use your shrouded step to run away before you even plant the spike.\\n\\n7: When defending a site, always push into the enemies and blind any allies helping you defend the site. Ideally you should abandon the site and take control of the attacker spawn, so that the enemies cannot retreat to their spawn safely.\\n\\n8: When retaking a site, fire your paranoia into the sky to give away your position and blind any enemies who happen to be 500m above you. Try to smoke off the exact same spot with multiple smokes to waste utility and confuse your enemies with your stupidity.\\n\\n9: When defending a site post plant, use your smokes to smoke off another bomb site where there are no enemies, and make sure to stand on the spike. When enemies start firing at you, make sure to use your shrouded step to run away from the spike, and allow the defenders to defuse the spike so that nobody dies, because human life is precious.\\n\\nThese were some tips for omen. Try to use them in battle and you shall ~~derank~~ rank up extremely fast.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'So I’m no stranger to problems with valorant. I haven’t really played at all recently because of the “required dependency” bug. I finally got that fixed and have been playing normally for a few days. Cut to tonight and I try to queue up for a match and I can’t because I need to download the new patch. So I restart valorant and everything works as intended, until I get to the character select screen and valorant crashes. This has never happened to me and I though it was confusing I thought it was a one time thing and relaunched. When I went to queue this time the game gave me a 2 min freeze for not picking a character! I wait it out and join a new game. Same thing happens to the letter. Join a THIRD game and I make it past character select and think everything is alright...ONLY FOR THE GAME TO CRASH ON SPAWN. I try to rejoin, and I’m able to, only to crash after another 15-30 seconds. I’m sure I’ve been reported by everyone in that match because none of them had mics so I doubt they heard me pleas for help between crashes. It’s to the point of unplayability and I don’t know what to do to fix it.\\n\\n*TL;DR*\\nGame keeps crashing after new patch. Has this happened to anyone else?\\n\\n\\nEDIT:Apparently disabling OverWolf fixes the problem, thanks u/MTOKA',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I placed gold 3 in beta and ranked up to imm1 and when the game was released I placed Plat 3 and am now Imm 2.  As someone who has seen both the high and low tier play, here are my suggestions for what changes should be made. I soloq'd about 95% of my games, so I have seen all different types of teammates.  This game's mechanics imo are amazing, and I really enjoy playing but these are the changes I would make...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1.  Raze currently has the highest combat score on [blitz.gg](https://blitz.gg)'s stats page.  Raze just got hit with an extra ult point nerf but I think a small but impactful nerf would be to make her satchels safe.  This means satchels do no damage output to teammates or enemies and just acts as a jumppad.  As someone who mains Raze myself I know how valuable the satchels can be without damage but the fact that you can take defusers off bombs and get kills on pistols with it seems op.  \\n2. The operator may be balanced more in the pro scene but for normal, competitive players it is nearly unstoppable when you are defending with a good economy.  This makes maps like Bind and Split really difficult for soloq players to counteract the Op on.  My suggestion would be to increase the price to 5000 as a temporary measure, but also to make it less mobile in the future.\\n3. B site on Bind is neither fun to attack nor defend.  The map is heavily defender sided in general, and the attackers don't have many options for taking site.  This is especially prevalent at the lower ranks, as b site hits are normally clunky and don't allow for free-flowing gameplay.  I would love to see a connection between hookah and long, and a staircase on the side of hookah where the box is, allowing for players to walk down instead of having to jump out.\\n4. Jett's dash with shotgun/op at times feels like it shouldn't be a part of the game to manipulate movement to the extent that she can, but she is balanced because of her weak utility.  However, I would still nerf her dash to go only 3/4 of the distance you can now, in order to allow the enemy team to have a chance at trading, unless used in smart, safe positions.\",\n",

And i know that a lot of players strongly prefer some maps and hate others (i'm talking about you split)\\n\\nAnd this, what seems to be pure random system creates big problem, playing same map over and over multiple times.\\n\\nFor example i played split 13 times  out of last 20 competitive games, ones 5 times in a row. We all know that maps in valorant have a lot of problems and frustrating areas. Having chance to play same map 5 or even 20 times in a row make this problem even bigger.\\n\\nBecause if its pure random system, everytime you queue every map has 25% chance of being chosen, that means you can theoretically play only one map over and over and there's NOTHING you can do about it. And its not really fun when you want to have fun competitive evening with friends and you play one map five times in a row.\\n\\nInstead i propose simple pseudorandom system.\\n\\nAfter you play map, your chance of getting that same map drops in half, so its 12.5%, if you get the same map again , its 6.25% and so on. Or it can drop even more or have assigned different parameters after playing, based on playtime etc..\\n\\nThis way it will feel more random and be more fun for everyone.\\n\\nAnd btw: Apple had this same problem when itunes came out, their shuffle feature used true random system and people were complaining that it picked same songs over and over because there was a chance for it to happen. After complaints, they made it pseudorandom so when song was played, its chance of playing again soon dropped radically.\\n\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nLot of people are saying that this is not possible or it is problem because there are 10 players and only four maps and everyone played different map last game.\\n\\nThis is not a problem at all. Here’s why:\\n\\nSystem would just match together players that played same maps last game and pick one of other three for that game.\\n\\nThat would be basically like you manually picking three out of four maps, but system will pick that three for you. This would result in slightly longer queue times. For example in cago you can solo queue just one map and you are just fine, and in this pseudorandom system you are queueing for three maps.\\n\\nThere is only ONE situation where this doesn’t work. If you play in four stack and each of you played different map last game, which will result in random map. But that is rare situation.\",\n",

It would also give people a reason to buy more than one skin for a specific weapon or melee. I personally really like the Oni skin for the phantom, and I already own a kingdom and prism variant of the weapon. I feel that a rotation feature would nudge me into buying the Oni, on top of the two I already have. This can work kinda like the one in Fortnite. You have it on random, and every game, it picks a skin you own to be that skin for the game. I just think this would be better than just having to choose one skin and only one skin. Either way, love what riot is doing with the cosmetics in this game and making things that fit everybody’s personal taste and style.',\n",

This is coming from someone who doesn't really like playing ranked. I just want to have fun, relax, score some frags, etc. I don't care that much about being top 100 NA or something.\\n\\n\\nThe maps are just *unfun*. The amount of times where you have to enter an area and be able to simultaneously check two corners on opposite sides of you is ridiculous. It feels like sometimes I have to have literal pro-league coordination with my team to take sites, so that we all push in from multiple angles at the same time and know which corners we're checking. \\n\\nIts not enjoyable to have to push on C site on Haven and have to check both my left and right side. There are so many angles in the game that require 270 degree vision. There are so many places that people can just camp and at a minimum get a 1 person trade, maybe more. \\n\\n\\nDefensive utility also feels far more powerful than offensive utility. Some places feel quite literally impossible to push against certain defenders. I often times hear that Cypher counts as 2 defenders in 1, but Sage can hold down sites on Haven and Split entirely on her own. I can pop every single one of my abilities as Brimstone on C Haven or B split, including my ultimate, but it doesn't matter when Sage just slows + walls us off and gives enough time for her entire team to rotate. \\n\\n\\nThe game just feels like long hallways with a few open areas dotted around which all conveniently are just massive chokepoints/funnels. I feel like a rat running through a maze except every fourth corner have a flamethrower pointing at me. These claustrophobic scenarios also conveniently tend to play perfectly into the hands of the Operator. \\n\\n\\nIts annoying that there really isn't a single position in the game an OP isn't good in defensively except playing a forward position in Hookah on Bind or playing a forward position in B site on Ascent.\\n\\nA site heaven on every single map? Perfect. Looking down the hallway on A site Split? Perfect. Looking into garage on B site Split? Also good. Peeking mid from vents on Split? Again, viable position. B site tower? Also works. \\n\\n\\nIts amazing that even with the attempts at creativity like including 3 bomb plants and teleporters, the maps still end up being hallways upon more fucking hallways. It makes offense a fucking nightmare to play on. I consistently get most of my round wins on the defense side because offense is so frustrating.\",\n",

(I'm Immortal 1, if that matters)\\n\\nGamesense 101\\n\\nGamesense is a skill in all FPS games that determines how aware a player is at any point in a game about the current situation/status of themselves and opponents given information that they are able to gather either themselves or through teammates. There is also a degree of intuition from information that you do not know where you must be either able to guess/predict to give you an advantage, the better your gamesense, the greater the advantage.\\n\\nBasics of gamesense:\\n\\n* Knowing where you are in relation to your team\\n* Knowing where you are in relation to your enemy\\n* Knowing where the enemy is and will go\\n* Knowing your current situation (are you advantageous or disadvantageous), your utility, their utility, your HP vs their HP\\n* Knowing the map your are playing, know roughly how long it takes to rotate between sites and plant, know the common plant positions and what they are planted for\\n\\nScenario: Haven, You are on Defender Side\\n\\nYour team has called an enemy team A execute, you see on the map that the site has been smoked so you don't know how many are coming from either Long/Short. Since the number of players taking the site is unknown, you must always assume that not every player will be taking site, here is where gamesense comes into play, from the previous rounds you have played, you need to determine if the enemy is aggressive or passive in their playstyle and executes, if the former, be aware that there may be a player aggressively lurking looking to flank the backlines while the defenders rotate, if they are more passive, be aware if you yourself are flanking, they may be holding deep angles waiting for your push.\\n\\n1 v X Scenario You should be asking yourself, how do I set-up as many 1v1 scenarios as possible with either my utility, positioning or communication gained from teammates.\\n\\nX v 1 Scenario Always have your teammates in view or be in a position to trade them, DO NOT give the enemy a chance to take 1v1 duels, hold crossfires and communicate what you are holding, think about how you would approach this from the opposite perspective, take the optimal positioning/try to have a wall against your back or teammate.\\n\\nThank you for reading this far, I hope any of this information can help you in your competitive matchmaking!\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Thought this might be useful, I’m not an expert but I’m sharing what worked for me at least.\\n\\n1. Don’t just play the game, don’t just practice and play the game, while playing the game, focus on how you died, eg: I shot him twice in the chest but he shot me once in the head, then think why that happened, so in this case my crosshair placement wasn’t good and then try to work on that. Try to catch yourself if you aim lower down at the ground until it becomes natural.\\n\\n2. In each game, if someone makes good call outs and is playing well, send them a friend request. Even if only 1/10 people accept, you could find at least a few after a week. Before playing competitive matches, invite them all and you can play better knowing you’re in safe hands.\\n\\n3. Try not to get disheartened by your rank. Considering I play quite a lot, I felt like I was hard stuck bronze forever, but I climbed from bronze three to silver 2 in a day and got to gold a week later. While it takes a while, the matchmaking system will eventually recognise if your skill is a lot higher then the people you play against.\\n\\n4. To rank up, sometimes you shouldn’t be trying to play how you see your favourite streamers like Hiko or Shroud play the game, as although that’s how everyone would dream to play like, they play a lot differently according to different opponents, better aim, etc. If you’re in bronze, play like a silver, if you’re in silver, play like a gold. Sometimes you have to mindlessly frag your way out of a rank.\\n\\n5. This one is more speculation than fact, but I feel that at least from Iron to Gold, ranks are split into two groups: Iron and Bronzes, and Silvers and Golds. \\nAt the very least I often played with irons in bronze and immediately played with golds after pushing to silver 1, and I have only ever played with one plat at gold 2. It is a lot harder to rank out of bronze than silver imo because you are playing with different players, so don’t get disheartened if you’re struggling.',\n",

It\\'s understandable that people compare this game to Counter Strike and think \"we\\'ve got flashes, smokes, and mollies\" and while those kinds of abilities do provide proven and effective utility for the gameplay of a tactical shooter, a variety of agents with drastically different abilities adds an entirely different level to the game. Anyone who has played LoL and has ever done the 5 support comp, or 5 tank comp knows what I\\'m talking about here. Those examples are cheesy and don\\'t work at the highest levels of competitive play, but even professionally, you see different kinds of team comps (poke comp, deathball, protect the hyper-carry, etc.) all with different strengths and weaknesses that create varied and interesting gameplay. \\n\\nI\\'m just going to list out here some examples of types of agent abilities that we might see in the future:\\n\\n* Ally buffs - Right now we basically have Sage\\'s heal/rez and Brimstone\\'s stim beacon, but there\\'s a ton that could be done here. Damage amplifiers, attack speed amplifiers, movement speed buffs, buffs to ally abilities (making AOEs larger, etc). And multiply all these with the different ways allies can be effected. They can be targeted on a single ally, affect a set part of the map, affect allies near you etc.\\n* Enemy debuffs - Right now, we have slows, flashes and ares of vision denial, but anything you could do to buff allies, you could do in reverse to debuff enemies. You can also do things like LoL silence (prevent them from using abilities), ways to force displacement of enemies, etc.\\n* Affecting terrain - Right now we only have Sage wall, but we could potentially have all sorts of terrain generation or terrain destruction. Imagine abilities that let you create a ramp or ladder that let your allies get to places they couldn\\'t otherwise reach, or abilities that open portals through terrain.\\n* Shields - Abilities that could block bullets, projectiles, or enemy abilities, walls that prevent movement through, but not bullets, etc.\\n* Trickery - Abilities that create decoys or clones. Abilities that change your character model and even hitbox. Abilities that mess with the enemy minimap, or even comms\\n* Adding effects to bullets - We see this a little bit with the tracer rounds in spike rush, but you could potentially add any sort of debuff on hit\\n* Movement - We have teleports, dashes, and jumps already, but we could have agents that walk up or hang from walls or ceilings\\n* Econ effecting - Characters could have abilities that reduce the cost of ally guns or abilities, agents could start with a particular gun, you could steal money from the opposing team, or increase the amount of money you get from kills or defuses.\\n* Stacking abilities - Abilities could increase in power as the game goes on, or from kills, spike plants, defuses, or orb collection\\n\\nNote that some of the things I\\'ve listed here are almost certainly unfun, or create play patterns that are counter to the overall design goals of the game (I\\'ve avoided mentioning anything \"melee\" here  or damaging abilities for that reason). I\\'m just rattling off these kinds of things because Riot really hasn\\'t even scratched the surface of the kinds of abilities they could in principle give agents.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Just a rant. I see people being toxic when they\\'re winning or it\\'s only round 3.\\n\\nValorant isn\\'t my first rodeo, used to play a LOT of CSGO with my friends, still go back to it occasionally. maybe its just because the counter strike crowd is older but it was rare to see people toxic while winning.\\n\\ngot carried by my friends to LEM when they took the game more seriously and got their globals. kind of regret not playing more religiously then and so valorant is like my second wind. i do find lots of awesome wholesome people in every other game. but i feel like its worth talking about how to enjoy losing games as part of the process.\\n\\nnow generally, i see two reasons ppl play fps:\\n\\n1. to git gud.\\n2. social thing with friends.\\n\\n**For those that want to git gud.** It is super important to enjoy losing to get better. If you\\'re winning then you\\'re playing against people that are worse than you. its why stomps are nice once in a while, but the game would get very boring if the opposing team were just complete noobs all the time.\\n\\nif you want to git gud as fast as possible then in a perfect world:\\n\\n1. you get absolutely stomped **while** giving your all in a game,\\n2. next you figure out all the things that went wrong,\\n3. suddenly absorb all that info and modify your play,\\n4. then face another even stronger team\\n5. rinse and repeat\\n6. PROFIT\\n\\nBy definition, a win will always mean less growth than a loss, because you will generally learn more from your mistakes the more of them you make.\\n\\nhonestly, **learn to love getting wrecked**. the only way to truly do this is to be able to figure out why you are getting wrecked. you can\\'t really tell if someone is hacking or is playing really well, so its super easy to be frustrated. but when you can see how and why people are playing well you will be in awe of their talent. respecting the good opponents is part of the game, because you have to play around that. if you think their lucky, you\\'re gonna play riskier and that can mean more losing.\\n\\nit\\'s always better to assume people are playing well because it means, you as a player can grow the most when attempting to overcome them. the more godlike they appear they greater you can potentially become when you overcome them; you may falsely figure out some sick strat and become a legend even if they actually are hacking.\\n\\nthere have been games where the enemy team had a counter strat to everything we did. they read us like books and played us like violins for the first quarter, it was brilliant. so clean, and crisp. and every time we thought back to the previous round, it made sense how and why they moved and pushed the places they did. the smoke positioning, the timings, the double peaking, ooff, it was majestic.\\n\\neven getting a single round off them was brilliant. and once we figured them out, it ended up being a super close game.\\n\\n***if you can\\'t appreciate a good loss, you won\\'t be able to play as much as the people that do, hence nor grow as much as they can.***\\n\\nIf the enemy team is clutching a 1v5, a part of you should be disappointed, but another part of you should be uwu\\'ing off the face of the earth. that doesnt mean you want it to happen, show the enemy some respect, give it your all to shut them down. and then slow clap or say \\'ns\\' or \\'well played sir\\' if they out do you. and ofc taunt them if they fail.\\n\\n**What about cheaters**? There is no greater feeling than awping a wall hacker or out playing an aimbot. sure the game is going to be super hard, but it reminds me of shonen moments where the protagonist is meant to die/lose but some quirk saves him; and part of the story is having to flesh out that unique ability later on. Eventually, *you* can draw out that hyper sense ability you acquired from these unfair matchups in fair decent games. I remember there was a saying that if you wanted to get to global elite (the highest cs rank) you had to pass that superhuman bot level. remember the tougher the challenge the more it reflects how superb you have to be. **and in a way its a compliment to your ability that win.exe is needed to beat you**\\n\\nsure you could get all anxious, and not even want to play. a spin bot really doesn\\'t have any solutions; perhaps the only thing you can learn are unknown wallbang spots. it may feel like if you try you\\'ll end up looking like a fool. but genuinely try your best, you want to lose feeling like you could\\'ve beat the hacker rather than being sad there was a hacker in the game, and you never know until you are giving your all if you can beat them.\\n\\nwhat if your team sucks? **if you\\'re playing with your friends,** remind yourself it doesn\\'t really matter about the game. ask them if they\\'re enjoying themselves, if not and they want to take it seriously don\\'t be afraid to try and give constructive advice, like why don\\'t we try X or you were pretty good at Y but I think you should do Z. if they actually are enjoying the games, troll a bit more, have fun, try strat roulette. **if you personally want to rank up more, get an alt!**\\n\\n**if you\\'re playing with randoms** and they suck, see if theres any advice you can give to help them. and be friendly. sometimes the mm thinks it\\'s your turn to carry a game. again be friendly, throw in \"nice trys\" everywhen. if theyre being toxic, practice defusing the situation especially if someone is being toxic to someone else, super useful skill, both in-game and in life. if you cant and its affecting your game just mute them. hopefully, they\\'ll be on the enemy team next game, and THEN you can trash talk as muuuuuuuuuuuch as you want.\\n\\n**directing your toxicity to the enemy can work too**. obviously be nice at the gg. but tbagging, trash talking are great ways to tilt people and win. I would argue it is part of the game because even at the pro-level getting in your opponent\\'s head is a big part of the game. plus I always love me some drama as long as its all well and good in the backrooms.\\n\\n**what if your aim sucks?** perfect opportunity to build game sense, you need to camp in unexpected corners; use shotguns, maybe flank the enemy team. use double peaks when defending, act as bait, work on your callouts, look at the minimap more. this is like the perfect time to hone your game sense. your goal is to use your brain to figure out the easiest shots you can take. when your aim comes back, you will be an even better player.\\n\\n**what if everything sucks?** its okay to have bad days, i think people play video games to escape something. and not being able to improve your mmr can feel bad. its nice to climb, but if you keep coming back down, it feels like you\\'ve wasted your time. kind of like falling to the bottom in games like jump knight. remember though, each time you learn something different. and its not really your mmr that determines how good of a player you are. instead its the other way round, how good of a player you are determines your mmr. so maybe all you really need to do is sit down and look at your past games, see what you\\'re doing wrong and try and fix those. just spam queueing isn\\'t going to make you feel any better. ***you*** need to change before your mmr does.\\n\\n**last thing**. this is hisoka:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8rjurms5uc51.png?width=245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b02151092cb2f13e19c61449e98cf04064e82d8\\n\\nhisoka gets aroused when he finds strong opponents or potential. be like hisoka.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hey guys,\\n\\nJust wanted to give an opinion on some of the community in this game and maybe some (obvious, but kind) words of wisdom for some others. I hope it’ll change your outlook on your team mates.\\n\\nFirstly, to all of you 1000+ hour CS pro’s or whatever other FPS you’ve come from. Please understand we aren’t all coming from the same background. Valorant is my first ever FPS and also my first ever PC game. \\n\\nI’ve, over time, learned the meaning of certain callouts (T, CT, U- Hall, etc.) but still, from time to time, the call out escapes my mind and i just use whatever name is on the map. One bad callout doesn’t warrant you to shout at said player. Just correct them and hopefully they’ll remember for next time. \\n\\nSecondly, inconsistency doesnt warrant you moaning/shouting. Once again, we’re not all coming from FPS backgrounds and dont all have perfect accuracy with hours in aim trainers. Im floating around Diamond 1/2 and some games i match with and will top frag vs Immortals. Other games my aim is barely worthy of Gold. I have 2 things to say about this. 1, if you’re the person who is having a bad game use your economy to help the team, buy your fragger weapons and go without if necessary. 2, if you notice someone having a bad game, dont give them shit. Encourage! I for one perform worse when team mates are getting on my back! Additionally to this point you guys need to understand, because we all aren’t skilled CS pro’s like so many are, we don’t all have perfect execute skills, plant skills or post plant skills. Just encourage one another and you’ll hopefully win the game hut if not, would have helped a team mate. \\n\\nLastly, the Valorant LFG discord can work well, but i’ve had countless bad experiences. As we all know SoloQ is somewhat annoying and very tedious. So, if you’re like me and have 0 PC friends you have to SoloQ or LFG. Please, please, if you’re making an LFG group and pick someone up who has a bad game i understand if you drop them but don’t just tell them they’re shit and to ‘f off’. Give them some advice on what to work on and how to work on it and then part ways. Simple. \\n\\nSorry for the rant and i appreciate if you’ve read this far. \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\nA kind Boomer ☺️',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Something I’ve seen a lot on Reddit is people (presumably newer/lower ranked players) being ‘timing’d’ (pushed while turning around, peeking while somebody just came to watch) and they often put it to luck or chance and that it was just bad timing.\\n\\nI think this is completely inaccurate 95% of the time. You were probably killed due to a change in the gamestate.\\n\\nThink about it as, literally, the state of the round/game. When something happens, the gamestate changes. If someone pushes and takes map control, if map control is lost, a kill occurs, an ability is used, these all result into a change of the gamestate and as such, most, if not all, players on the server have to react. \\n\\nWhen something happens and you think “I should turn to watch something else”, you have probably reacted due to a change in the gamestate and as such, so has the player who pushed ‘randomly’.\\n\\nThe way to counter this is to anticipate events when the gamestate changes. If you take mid control on Haven, take the initiative to realise they will try and take map control elsewhere, expect it and punish it.\\n\\nIf a teammate is killed, the other team will probably commit to taking control where the kill is. As such, take initiative and take map control but know that there may be someone watching as they may understand this idea.\\n\\nGLHF gamers.',\n",

For example, to get the purple/dark skin for the elderflame OP, you must upgrade the VFX, the animation, and also the finisher. I think RIOT should give you an option to turn specific animation upgrades on and off just like how you can switch which skin is on the gun. Personally, I don't like how the elderflame OP is pulled out when upgraded, BUT I love the VFX it gives and also the finisher; and also, I like the skin options.

       "   'selftext': 'Before getting into Valorant I was a longtime League player, playing on and off since Season 2. One of the big factors that led to me quitting earlier this year was that I felt Riot would never change their ways and start giving legitimate punishments to players who are clearly griefing (not just having a bad game) or AFK\\'ing games. I\\'ve really been enjoying Valorant, but I still feel that these issues are just as bad here.\\n\\nAFK\\'ing feels like a huge problem right now, there will be days when every game or two there\\'s an AFK on a team, just the other day I ff\\'d for the first time when we had to play a 3v5. What\\'s the punishment for this? A short (I\\'ve heard from 5 minutes to an hour) matchmaking cooldown. An hour? That\\'s it? You effectively ruin a game for 4 people and your punishment is you have to do something else for an hour? When I first started playing League I AFK\\'d one time, and got an instant 24 hour ban, thousands of games later and I\\'ve never intentionally AFK\\'d again.\\n\\nI will concede that Riot is having serious client/server issues atm, I\\'ve gotten error codes that kick me a few times, so until that stabilizes I can understand why they dont wanna be banning dudes for AFK\\'s, but is this an excuse for griefing?\\n\\n I just played a game where my botfrag gold 1 omen blamed the two silvers who were doing better than him for \"baiting him\", and he proceeded to grief for 12 the next 12 rounds. A 9-3 stomp turned into a 13-12 clutch because one guy decided he didn\\'t want us to win anymore; he\\'d sit in base with staring at corners, wouldn\\'t move even when he had bomb, intentionally smoked/flashed us on pushes. What do I expect will happen? Absolutely nothing. Having played league for years I know that nothing will happen for griefing unless a dude is reported a billion times, and then if he does get punished it\\'s not gonna be for more than a week.\\n\\nAt what point will Riot actually step in and punish players who ruin the game for others? They\\'re so afraid of losing potential customers that they alienate their dedicated players.',\n",

He grew up in a civilisation called rockilians. They roamed the depths of the Earth trying to live peacefully against their enemies, zelons, who could control metals. The zelons had terrorized the rockilians for years until the rockilians created a group of warriors called the Almighty, to protect their culture and people. One day, the zelons raided a rockilian town and murdered Obsidians parents. From that day on he had done whatever it takes to protect others. After a couple years of trying to protect other rockilians, he was invited to the Almighty however there was a blast of lava that shot him straight up to the surface of Earth, where he was now partially made up out of molten lava. Valorant had been trying to track him down for years until Obsidian had found them. From that moment on Obsidian had been a part of Valorant.\\n\\nFirst Ability (C) - Rock Shatter - 2 uses - $200\\n\\nUpon activation, it Summons a rock in his hands from the ground beneath him. Upon pressing the ability button again, he casts his rock onto any floor or wall and when an enemy walks on it or next to it, it damages and dazes the player for 2 seconds.\\n\\nLike cypher trap but instead of info it damages. Only sound queue no detection.\\n\\nSecond Ability (Q) - Molten Lava - 2 uses - $200\\n\\nUpon activation, he reaches into the ground and picks up some some hot rock, when you press \"lmb\" he throws the rock onto the floor/surface and activates the molten lava. The molten lava does 50dps when stood in it and it gives a burning de-buff once stepped of of it for 3 seconds. The melting de-buff does 10dps.\\n\\nIt is like viper\\'s snakebite but instead of vulnerability it gives burning. Brimstone\\'s molly is 60dps which is 15 damager per 0.25 seconds.\\n\\nSignature Ability (E) - Rock Pillar - 2 uses - regenerates every 30 seconds\\n\\nBrings a pillar of rock on a suggested marker which can boost a teammate or himself onto an elevated position.

       "   'selftext': 'Omen main here. I absolutely love Omen’s abilities and how he can help the team, but I feel like his Ult is underpowered compared to other agents. \\n\\nMy problem with it is that any team that’s halfway decent is going to be listening for the enemy Omen as soon as they hear “scatter.” When I’m on defense, if you Ult out to flank you are giving up a crucial angle that you are holding (and the other team is going to be checking their flank for you anyways). If it’s a fake and you Ult to help at A, you basically give up B completely and vice versa. \\n\\nOn offense the Ult isn’t super helpful on Bind, Ascent, and Split. I’ve Ult’d to probably every site there and I’m lucky to get one pick so my team can advance before the defense takes me out. My one caveat is I think the Ult is a lot more useful on Haven since it’s a more spread out map. \\n\\nThen you look at the Ult points. Valorant is basically saying Omen’s Ult is more useful than Phoenix getting a free life to charge forward onto a site for a pick and equally useful to Sage being able to res a teammate.\\n\\nFor me, Omens Ult has basically turned into a Sova recon arrow. I just Ult onto site to gain info on where the enemy team is and then cancel before I get one tapped to the dome. \\n\\nI’m not really sure how I would change Omens Ult if I could, but when I mess around in spike rush/unrated with other agents I feel like I get way more use out of their Ult.',\n",

A mysterious substance called radianite struck the earth. It quickly devoured the things around it, including people. Those who had come in contact with this sheer elemental energy were called radiants, people with superhuman abilities. However, the radiants didn’t know their power and as such, chaos ensued. Crime was at an all time high, the world was already ravaged by the first light and it couldn’t handle the sheer amount of people who now had unprecedented power. There was still hope, though, as a company called the Kingdom created a shadow organization called the VALORANT protocol. It recruited agents, comprised of both radiants and non-radiants. However, these people were in desperate need of training and as such, were cloned and put into teams. These teams would then fight in controlled locations and were given one objective or the other. Plant the spike, a radianite powered bomb, or defuse and protect various sites. This training method proved effective and the teams were dispatched to various areas to help control the radiants and sometimes recruit agents. The original 11 were recruited from various places, from Mexico to Sweden to Russia. Even those who weren’t radiants were objectively just as useful.\\nThis organization went on to control the spread of radianite, but there was something sinister behind the scenes...',\n",

From the starting of the day I would play until I get a very nice score and a win and that's it. Note that this only happens when I win a game, there is no problem until I get a satisfying win but once I get it I just can't hit the play again button, not at least before taking a 15 mins breaktime. \\n\\nI am writing this right after a valorant game where I was the top frag with 23/3/5 KDA and a 13-1 win. After that, I couldn't hit the play again button at the bottom of the score screen. As a result I was too scared to play again and I quit the game and started writing this. \\n\\nThis causes a huge problem for me and that is the loss of warm up. I know if I play a game right after such a beatiful game, the chances are high that I win another one with that warmed up and ultra focused mind state. Instead I just quit the game and wait for at least 15 mins (sometimes it extends to 1 hour until I feel ready again) to lose my warm up to play worse the next match I play.\\n\\nWhat could be the reason for this and how can I overcome it?

I know this was just covered with Cypher, but it\\'s still a bit of a problem for characters like Raze and Jett. \\n\\nMy suggestion is to make the \"Q\" button require two clicks before abilities are used in buy phase. So, if you want to place a satchel charge as Raze, you have to hit Q+Q rather just Q. Same with Jett, if you want to Updraft in buy phase it should be Q+Q instead of Q. \\n\\nI think this will help out tremendously, as a lot of people simply move their hands off the keyboard when they\\'re in buy phase and lose an ability for no real reason during a match.

I don't fucking care if you bottom frag with a  .05 KD. sure maybe you got carried this game but so what?!? the problem this game has is that it only cares about K/D. Literally the only thing it actually cares about. 13-7 win is SIGNIFICANT. almost twice the wins as the other team! That's literally dominating. Now what happens is sometimes on offence or even defence things just don't go your way. Defence this could mean literally, shut a team down once and they never come your way again leaving all the killing to your team, if they are also dominating guess what you get to rotate into MAYBE a kill if you're lucky. Even if what you are doing with your utility or decision making is making a huge impact on the game if you don't frag out it just doesn't matter for your rank.  You can be just absolutely buttering up the other team by forcing them out of position, cutting off their sightlines so your teammates can get better positioning to take those advantageous fights, swinging wide so your teammate can get the trade. NOPE this clearly doesn't matter at ALL. It's fucking dumb and Id love to hear someone argue that this system is working properly.\",\n",

I’d also like to suggest a couple ways to allow this without affecting the competitive aspect of the game, which is clearly important to the devs and community alike.\\n\\nAll that said, I also think it’s important to address the fact that people are already doing this. It’s not all that difficult to set up an account in a different region, and ultimately people do want to play with their friends. In some cases, this may even be necessary to play in the first place!\\n\\nCS:GO, if I remember correctly, has an option to queue for a certain ping - you can fine tune your threshold and only get matches with players below it. This has some flaws - setting a default threshold could cause issues across the board, from ruining competitive games in well supported regions to barring off players who don’t have the option for lower ping games (e.g. Africa, South-East Asia, etc). With some fine tuning however, I think this could be viable - in fact, something as simple as no ping cap for Unrated and a configurable (or hard!) cap for Competitive could be perfect. This allows people to play with their friends and gives competitive players more control than they currently have. The default value for this cap would need serious consideration of course, but I think it could be done well.\\n\\nOther options are possible - different settings per region, per gamemode, etc. I understand it’s a complex issue, but better systems are definitely possible and worth looking into!\\nAny suggestions other people have are encouraged and overall I’d like to just get the conversation going to see if people are supportive of the current system or not. Thanks!',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"HI. I want to talk about the RANK REWARD in Valorant in the future. I am a 4400 rank Overwatch Player in Season 3 from China. Back then, there are lots of my friend and some other people with lower rank levels want me to help them get the GrandMaster as 4000 OW rank reward. So they all come to me and let me help them to get the  Rank Season head portrait and the Painting. Me and my other teammate who use to play start using their account to play. We can beat the player can't even contest us and the account owner can get the reward they want. we happy and they happy. Because VALORANT is a free game and everyone can find a balance between competing and just have fun. So I just don't want VALORANT Rank to become like OVERWATCH. Because I know some dark shit in Overwatch Rank in China. Things like Smurf or Boosting happen all the time. But the most shocking thing is some high-rank players they have a group and they agreed to match at the same time in the mid-night. so they can get in the same match So they can manipulate the whole match. If someone says they want to win in their group. They can act and do some black casework to let the guy who gives money to them to win. I really don't want account trade and Boosting in the game become popular and ordinary in VALORANT. So I think the rank reward even not necessary. Because to be good and have fun in-game is already a nice reward. And the environment in competitive is pretty good right now. Please be careful with the rank reward and I really hope this game can be better day by day\\n\\n（i'm not good in English so this article may write not well enough, please forgive me）\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hi, so we’ve been throwing a local valorant league recently, where we stream some of the matches between teams. I’m not a good player and there really is a ton of action that I tend to miss\\n\\nMy approach so far has been to put more of my POV focus on attacker side, and when round starts I tend to pick an area I think a clash is bound to happen based on the mini map. (Ie I see 2-3 guys on each side approaching mid on bind)\\n\\nIf this big engage happens then I’ll press V to go into drone mode and do my best to get a wide angle of all this firefight. \\n\\nAs players get picked off I’ll try to just pick players who I think have to carry the game on their shoulders. Ie if the bomb carrier hasn’t planted the spike I’ll focus on him as the round is predicated on him planting  or if there’s 1 - 2 guys left on defense I’ll just jump between the two of them since if they die they lose. \\n\\n\\nUltimately, there are times when there are firefights at both bomb sites and I’ll miss quite a few frags. \\n\\nLooking for any tips right now on how I can improve on the specutating experience for our stream viewers of the tourney. \\n\\nPs\\nI use all the numerical hot keys for players as well as the mouse buttons, and I use the V key for the drone perspective. \\n\\nIf you are interested in what I’m talking about you can see the first VoD at twitch.tv/latteesports for reference.',\n",

And the match will end after one team wins 6 rounds so that it would be that long or too short. And just like a normal game the attacking only has 1 spike. I kinda wanna see interactions of each agent comps. Like imagine 5 Brimstones just smokes the entire site kinda creating a viper ult and they just rush in and plant the spike. That would probably be fun (well atleast for the Brimstone players). But i don't know if other people would want this but it could be a good addition for gamemodes in Valorant\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Let me get this out of the way, I am in no way great at the game, but the things I am talking about aren\\'t directly related to gameplay. These are just my thoughts on the game, however bad they may be. I am currently Gold 3 but don\\'t really play this game a ton, which is where my gripes with the game start. Just a warning, this is a long post, there is a TLDR at the end if you don\\'t want to read.\\n\\nI play games for fun, not obligation. The current length of the battlepass feels like an obligation. I shouldn\\'t have to play \\\\~3 games a day to fulfill the battlepass. There are many other games that I would like to play. Dedicating a portion of my day to playing Valorant just to fulfill the battlepass makes me not want to play the game. Sure, the 10$ battlepass is a pretty OK deal. You get a handful of decent skins and a good amount of Radianite. But good lord, spending what seems like 100 hours just to get these items feels awful. I also play a decent amount of TFT, hovering around diamond 4, where I have also bought the battlepass. I have not played a ton of TFT this season because I just genuinely feel the patches are pretty inconsistent, but that isn\\'t the point. The point is as I stated above, \"I have not played a ton of TFT.\" I have not played a ton, and I have missed a multitude of weekly missions worth hundreds of XP to the battlepass... but I am almost done with it. I have at no point felt like \"I need to play TFT for the battlepass...\" There are just enough weekly missions, and xp given out at the end of a game to just... have enough for playing if it\\'s only 1 game a day. Despite all of this, I do believe that the battlepass is CLOSE to being a battlepass that I would buy again. If they just shaved off even 1k from each tier, or even slightly more than 1k, it would be great. That\\'s 50k off, or about a weeks worth of XP if you play as much as I do.  \\n\\n\\nThe other hot topic is the price of skins. For comparison I will be taking Riot\\'s other game, League of Legends. Looking at Valorant, you have skins that are either a balanced price, usually the ones without upgrades. And the skins with upgrades. Now... the problem isn\\'t the price of the skin in my opinion, it\\'s Radianite. When the dragon skins came out, I thought $92 was a bit overpriced, but I was on the verge of thinking of it as acceptable. HOWEVER, I saw a reddit post how upgrading the whole pack would run you $292... That\\'s fucking absurd. In no world would I ever pay $292 for fully upgraded skins. Take a look at League of Legends now. There is currently a bundle in the shop containing 5 champions, 5 skins, one for each of the champions, 2 ward skins, and 5 icons running for 11250 RP. This makes it so you have to buy the $100 pack. Well now take a look at what each of the skins offers. FULL VFX, sounds, backing animations, and emotes... The $100 pack of RP gives you 15,000 RP. You buy the full pack, you still have around 4,000 RP left over. The difference between Valorant and League is atronomical, even when it\\'s the same company. Now let me run some comparisons past people. 1275 for an Avalance Vandal... pretty good skin in my opinion and I think it deserves it\\'s price... until you look at comparisons. League of Legends runs good quality skins, complete with VFX, sounds, and the skin itself for a minimum of 1350. This requires you to get the $10 pack of RP for ALL VFX, sounds, and skin. Looking at a skin like the recent infernal skins (Karthus, Kennen, Vel\\' Koz). Take a look at Valorant. You are asking (\\\\~$18, rounding up). Meaning you are going to have to buy the $20 pack for the Oni Phantom. Fine, that\\'s acceptable in my opinion. Then add Radianite on top of that. You are going to have to buy the 5350, $50 VP pack in order to buy the 4800 pack of radianite. You are now looking at \\\\~$70 for ONE skin, complete with VFX, Sound, and the skin itself. Quite frankly... it\\'s fucking asburd. People using the \"it\\'s a free to play game\" excuse are being a little blind, or just haven\\'t played League of Legends for instance. League has quality skins, for about half the price if you are adding in Radianite. Once again, let me compare. I can get Infernal Karthus, complete with VFX, Sound and the skin for 1350 ($10). For the Oni Phantom, fully upgraded, with VFX and sound and the skin, you are looking at 1775 for the skin ($20 pack) and 4800 for 80 Radianite ($50 pack), for a total of $70 dollars. Yea.... no. Remove Radianite and I would be OK with the price of skins.  \\n\\n\\nDo I think Riot will change this? Absolutely not. There are already enough people buying them to make it a pretty clear case that they would not lower the price of skins. Do I think that they will lower requirements of the battlepass? Also no, they want people to play their game, whether they feel obligated or for fun.   \\n\\n\\nTL:DR Battlepass is too long and feels like an obligation. Even taking 1k xp off of each tier would go a long way I think. Skins are a balanced price... EXCEPT for Radianite upgrades. Radianite is a plague that should be removed. League of Legends offers skins complete with FULL VFX, sounds, backing animation and sometimes emotes for 1350... ($10). Compared to the new Oni Phantom which runs \\\\~$70 for the same features.  \\n\\n\\nI would love to hear thoughts on this. I know there is already a noticeable discussion about this on the internet, but I wanted to throw my two cents out there, even if it gets ignored. Have a good day.',\n",

Mark my words, this could change once Killjoy comes out, but Cypher is the best agent in the game right now. He is irreplaceable in pro play, with I think a 100% pickaxe in NA tourneys. Right now, Cypher is harder to counter without a cypher than the Operator. \\n\\nIn my opinion, even at the very highest level the most an agent should be picked is 80 or 85% with 4 maps. Aka, slightly more than a one map exception. Even Sage is less used than Cypher, because of Ascent (and sometimes but extremely rarely Bind). \\n\\nIt should not be a requirement at the most competitive level to pick any specific agent on the majority of the maps. We are supposed to pick from 5 agents, not 4. Lmk what you guys think, but imo even though Cypher is \"best\" he doesn\\'t really feel broken, maybe just consistently a little overpowered.',\n",

Please stop taking everything so literally.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that yes, Raze\\'s and Killjoy\\'s abilities do kill. But you\\'re so upset that you\\'re only looking at one sentence of the tweet. If you collected yourself for one second, you\\'d read the rest of the tweet. \"Characters have abilities that *augment* their gunplay instead of fighting directly with their abilities.\"\\n\\nAnd that\\'s exactly correct. Raze\\'s abilities *augment* her gunplay instead of fighting directly. Any good Raze player will not run directly at you with her abilities out. You cannot directly fight an entire team 25 full rounds with just her abilities. (Mostly) \\\\[for you devil\\'s advocates out there\\\\]\\n\\nNow can you play an entire match using only Raze\\'s abilities and 0 guns. Sure. Are you going to win or even get many kills? Probably not. Your team would say you\\'re throwing and get upset at you.\\n\\nIf you\\'re this upset at Raze and Killjoy while we\\'re at it why not just complain about Molotov, Hot Hands, and Snake Bite since they can kill too. Do you see how ridiculous that sounds?\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t even mention that there\\'s literally 0 Agent imbalance in the game because BOTH teams can have the exact same Agents. Now I do believe all Agents should be balanced, and imo Riot has done an amazing job of that, compared to any other multi-character shooter I\\'ve ever seen**. I see no reason to continuously rail Riot for something they haven\\'t even done wrong.**\\n\\nStop complaining about an Agent that hasn\\'t even been released yet. You\\'re not pointing out any issues because there are no issues. **All you\\'re going to do is make Riot employees more scared to post anything on Twitter that might be taken the wrong way.** Which is not what we want. We want open communication both ways.',\n",

Literally the same reason why 1 person cant decide when the entire team forfeits...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI dont understand. So basically, if theres 1 troll on your team, if you dont want to play with that person youre just shit outta luck because YOU get punished for leaving a game where your team doesnt want to win. Seriously? I just got held hostage in COMP , because 2 people just didnt want to play to win the game. On offense they would rush to the spike before anyone else, and hold it, forever and not plant. The only way to win was to kill all people, but once they realized that we werent planting, they were just hiding, so unless we were winning our game of hide and seek we were just losing rounds :)  On defense they didnt even bother to hold a site obviously, actually they were legitimately communicating with the enemy team throughout the entire game, and im sure if there were dancing emotes they wouldve just been dancing with the enemy, instead they were just tbagging eachother unless anyone that wasnt trolling showed up, then they would attempt to kill them. Even IF we won that game, which was close like 9-12 or something, it doesnt even matter. I honestly just didnt want to play with people who dont wanna play the game lmao. Why am I FORCED to play out this game or get penalized in situations like this? Literally just put in /votekick or if thats too difficult, maybe make it majority rules on a Forfeit??? Why the fuck, can ONE person out of 5, stop a forfeit vote? As shitty as it is, if people dont want to play a competitive game like valorant to win, and just troll, who the fuck cares, just make it easier for people to get out of a game without Alt F4ing.',\n",

Raze was already walking a pretty thin line but Killjoy puts a really bad look on the future of the game. I dont see a world where the game goes into a direction that does not require a shield champ and I think having a shield champ would defeat the purpose of this game. Considering Riot made it clear the game was gun play focus and the abilities were not suppose to be purely damage, if the turret is suppose to be weak and used for a distraction or as intel why make its only function to shoot people for you. Just because we can manipulate its function to be more than just an aimbot turret, doesnt mean it isnt at its core a bot with a gun that takes away the main focus of gun play.. In what world does a turret whose main objective is to shoot people a fundamentally ok thing to have in the game.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I maimed sage for a while as I was new to PC gaming, my aim wasn’t (and still isn’t) good, but recently I’ve been top fragging in my cues. I know sage is not an entry fragger, so I didn’t want to put my team in a bad position every round while trying to get a kill. They suggested I switch to a duelist, so I tried Reyna out for a few unranked games and I went 9/2/0 in my first where the other team ff, then the next game I went 36/17/6. As I got more comfortable with her I found myself putting myself in very bad situations, and due to my poor aim I die in most 1v1 situations. What should I do?\\n\\nI’m very strategic with how I play Sage, I’m patient, I hold angles and am extremely good at predicting enemy movements and plays, but with Reyna all that goes out the window, and I turn into an idiot looking for frags. Any Advice? Should I just keep working on Reyna, Switch back to Sage, it is there an operator i should try out?',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"Dear Riot,\\n\\nIve been looking around YouTube, Twitter and Reddit about Valorant and something that I'm always seeing is that people want more maps and less agents. And to be honest, I totally agree. Let's start with more agents, if riot continues with their word and make 1 agent every 2 months (6 agents a year) the game will become another Overwatch. There would be every ability you could think about, the game would lose itself inside the amount of agents. I would personally half that with 3 or maybe even 2 agents a year. This would keep the game fresh but at the same time give each agent time to be balanced, find its place in the meta, be understood by the players etc. Another thing that would be a side effect of less agents are less bugs and better performance because riot would be spending less time on adding things and more time on fixing things.\\n\\nNow to maps. The maps in Valorant have alot of work to be done, if I want to peak a angle I don't want to be shot in the back by someone holding another angle. I do know there are reasons for this but Ascent is in my opinion, a almost perfect map for Valorant, there ain't to many angles to peak and hide in, its clean, not many angles are awkward to hold and its got long range places has well has short range places. I'm not sure how many maps riot are thinking of putting into Valorant but I do hope that it is a few, maybe once again 2 or 3 a year and maybe if a map isn't liked give it a re-skin or re-design. \\n\\nIn conclusion, add more maps and less agents. (And a profile feature) Thanks :)\",\n",

The gameplay can feel repetitive with the poor map rotation. For example, I will get 3 Ascents in a row then 2 splits in a row without seeing Bind or Haven the whole day. I think that the extra time to design we agents would be beneficial also, as they can focus more on differentiating the different agent's strengths and weaknesses.

Although not a powerful one on its own, it got me quite a few times in my last match, where for quite a few rounds, they had someone holding just to the left of the B main exit as well for a crossfire, and my team lost 1-2 people per round to that setup, so I wanted to find something to flush the defender out of there. \\n\\nI tried it in an unrated game after finding the lineup and it helped my team pick up a free kill on the fleeing defender, so I'll probably use it in the future. Feel free to tell me if it's useless though. :D\",\n",

But if you want to fix it. These are changes I would adapt.\\n\\n1) Matches where your team forfeits should not count towards ranked.\\n2) 20 matches to enter ranked is not nearly enough for a free to play game. Make it closer to what League of Legends has.\\n3) Set up a system that sorts people like Prime on CSGO does. Not necessarily saying make the same system. Just make a system that separates newly ranked accounts from established ranked accounts. So you have a playerpool that you will enter for your first X amount of hours of ranked. And after that amount of hours you can elect to play in the veteran player pool. Your rank would be the same between both pools but in the veteran pool you should be less likely to play a smurf bc of the rank progression earned in the lower pool. \\n\\nThis isn't perfect, and I'm sure other people could add good ideas to it. But this would imo greatly enhance the experience in both ranked and unranked.\",\n",

I feel like once you get the hang of the recoil, maps, abilities, have game sense, and a little luck, the game is extremely fun. There's a lot of mixed reviews of the game from my friends thus far, but what does everyone else think about the game?   \\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, I think I've been playing an excessive amount lol. I played 8 hours straight back to back matches with no breaks in between and woke up with my arm straining. I did some research and I think I got something called bicep tendinitis. The muscle that controls your arm rotation and elbow extension is controlled by this muscle. I read that there is no long term damage, however it has been a couple days since the pain. I think it is getting worse lol, I've been icing it. Does anyone have any suggestions? I would go to the doctor, but I don't have health insurance lol\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'While I do agree with what we’ve heard from the devs and especially Morello about why damage abilities do not “break the game,” I do think that they can be too powerful. As I see it each one serves a specific purpose. The Boom Bot is for scouting and potentially clearing angles and corridors, the Paint Shell is for pressuring opponents out of cover or into flankable positions, and the Blast Pack is for maneuvering. The Showstopper ult seems to serve no purpose other than to create a large, high damage explosion. The Boom bot is easy to avoid or destroy so if it kills, you that’s mostly your fault and if you destroy it, it has already served its purpose. The Blast Pack probably won’t damage you so it’s not a huge deal. My main issue is with the Paint Shell and the Showstopper. The Paint Shell is unstoppable and should be or else it’s purpose is defeated, but it should not be able to kill someone with full health and heavy shields, in fact it shouldn’t ever do enough damage to kill someone with full health or else it really is too powerful. The last thing is the ult, it’s way too powerful and can kill multiple people at full health/shields in a large area with no other tactical purpose. I think she needs a completely different ult, not completely sure what that would look like but the way it is does not work.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Hi,\\n\\nI\\'m plat2 rn (started on gold1, rank up to dia1, but lost some games in the past scince I try solo queue more often) and wanted to share my (very long) opinion on why MM currently sucks.\\n\\nHere are two things I hate the most:\\n\\n- lack of communication:\\nOnly 20% of the games 1-2 players are making callouts. 80% of the games it is just me talking and giving Info to myself through voice chat. Sometimes they still flame and tell you what to do using voice chat but giving info: naaah xd how about reporting them so they can give less Info because of mute xD\\n\\n- misunderstanding of their role: \\nIn 90% of my games people dont know what role they are playing. Pheonix should entry with flashes, nope he holds angle. This is what 80% of the players do on attacker side: holding angles, get stucked somewhere or my favourite player who is lurking as reyna/raze/omen on the other side of the map not getting intel but just starring at a wall waiting for us to die so he can start moving to the other bomb site.\\n\\nMy opinion why these issues are there in the first place:\\n\\n- lack of communication: \\nIn EU there are ltrly servers with voice disabled! So in ~10-15% of my games I have the privileged to play on those servers. ( Why...?? )\\nAlso there is no reward for being a communicative and helpful teammate. Sooo why should anyone give info who dont understand that valorant is a team-based tactic shooter? Also there is this: \"i need my silence to lurk around the map\" mentality which is due how the game is designed. (Yes it is designed that way because it is hard to keep a momentum and most times anyone who approaches a site will die first and all the momentum is gone in 70% of the time) \\n\\n- misunderstanding of roles: \\nPlayers who never dived deep into cs go or something comparable cannot know that there are certain roles in a tactic shooter. Valorant forces players to assign themselves a role at the beginning but NEVER tell them what there actual role is. \\nIt says duelist but u can take duels by holding angles too! \\n\\nPlayers who take duelist and not entry have done nothing wrong from the game\\'s point of view. They are rewarded the same or even better than a poor brim or sage who have to enter a site and die... \\n\\nAlso its fuking scary for a duelist to go first. Why? \\nThere are traps, slow orbs, smokes, mollies and enemies waiting for you around the corner. \\nOfc they are all counterable but when it comes to a push you have to kill the trap or walk through a smoke in 80% of the time and you will die in 50% of the time or even worse aaannnd thats where the game punishes you for being a noob who dies without a kill and you end up being last place although you are doing what you are fk supposed to do!! \\n\\nAnother point is that there are so many things that slows you down but not enough things to keep the momentum. \\nIn csgo you decide to entry a side and ct throw a molly, you can counter it with a smoke. They smoke you off, you can counter it with a flashbang. There are always options to keep your momentum! \\nIn Valorant you waste 2 smokes at the start of an entry. Than you walk into a cypher trap and loose momentum ( i have never seen a team mate destroying a trap for me ), walk into a slow orb and loose momentum (dont even think about a sage wall), walk into smoke and loose team momentum cause in most cases you team will not follow you even if you flash out. In cs go it is your TEAM who flashes for the entry fragger and than follows him. It works because the big balls entry fragger can go out (and flash himself too) while the others follow him scince they threw a flash and are somehow commited to this site. An entry fragger in Valorant has to deal with flashing and clearing corners alone... No wonder players are scared to entry.\\nValorant is clearly forcing players to play as a team and play a role,  trade kills but they dont reward it. In cs go you dont need these rewards cause everyone can play any role during a match. \\n\\nHow I think these issues can be addressed: \\n\\n- lack of communication: \\nRate your teammate after game in a way that is transparent and rewarding: \\nMaybe give them a skin/badge at the end of an act. \\nPunish the toxic or non communicative players by queueing them together. \\n\\nRemove that stupid mute punishment for misusing voice chat. Who ever came up with this idea...\\n\\n- misunderstanding of roles: \\nWrite a little more about what role the agent should take. Raze is not played the same as pheonix but yes they are both duelist! Make it somehow clear that certain agents have a certain purpose... Raze for aoe control and deny. Pheonix for searching first engagements and soo on. \\n\\nReward teamplay more. Like entry on a site where bomb gets planted should give as much econ as 3 kills. Or trading should give more econ, smoking off angles should give econ and so on. plenty ideas how to reward good plays.\\nPunish those lurkers and baiters with wrong role more by not ranking after kills in scoreboard but after econ rating. So everytime they press tab they are last place not 1st or 2nd. Make them loose rank faster while players who play there role correctly can uprank faster or at least hold a rank longer.\\nOfc there are designated lurker agents which will receive a reward for lurking.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it from me. pls  Make this game better for the majority of players in g1 - dia1 @riotgames.\\nThx for reading',\n",

If you reach a rank but never win a game in that rank, it's as if you never reached that rank at all on your profile.\\n\\nPersonally, I think the moment of promotion should be the biggest, most hype moment of playing competitive and trying to achieve a higher rank; that's the moment where I feel my work has paid off, and where people will congratulate you on your progress, NOT your first or 9th win in that new rank.\\n\\nValorant's new system takes much of the hype of reaching a new rank away, and I think Riot should take another look.

       "   'selftext': \"First off, every other agent in Valorant has a cohesive colour scheme centered around one colour or shade of a colour that is unique to themselves. The only exceptions to this are Breach and Brimstone, who have other muted tones on their clothes. However, KJ is a disaster. She has green and yellow with purple accents in two shades, and her abilities have barely any resemblance to her. \\n\\nHer yellow jacket also looks weirdly bulky and IMO feels like it could turn into a super sized Cypher hat or Sage ponytail. On the agent select screen it doesn't look too bad but in game it looks twice as bulky. I can understand Riot trying to base her around a nerdy sort of hacker, but I don't see why she can't look like a sleek sort of spy rather than a four year old who dressed themselves. In her  smaller agent profile in loading screens and the top bar during games, the details are even more overwhelming due to the smaller scale. Her bangs. hat, and glasses combined with her brighter colours and highlights and different facial expression compared to the rest of the agents make her stick out like a sore thumb. Her hair also feels really off and physics defying as it is very stiff rather than more fluid like.\\n\\nAside from her character design itself, her abilities feel even more horrendous as they add even more bright, flashy colours. The other abilities are relatively colourful, such as Sage walls, Viper toxin or Reyna flashes, but they are centered around that agents colour or shade and are far less vibrant and saturated. KJ's abilities match with the Glitchpop skins better than they do to KJ.\\n\\nTL;DR, KJ is an eyesore and reminds me of young children doing arts and crafts.\",\n",

       "   'selftext': 'If dev\\'s are going around looking for feedback on the beta mode, hopefully they\\'ll find this useful?\\n\\nOn health pickups:  \\nMy assumption on the developer\\'s intent for this mechanic is to encourage players to navigate the space, particularly with deadly long range weapons that would otherwise be more powerful sitting in a corner. In this sense, I think the pickups are a very successful mechanic and I\\'ve caught out multiple people (and been caught out by multiple people) going for heals. However, I find it hard to tell when a pickup is going to run out with the current shrinking icon, and I don\\'t think it was the developer\\'s intent to make the pickups ambiguous. I think that some other visual indicator should be used for how long the pickup will last, for example having the cross symbol empty like a battery icon.\\n\\nOn radar pinging:  \\nI\\'m pretty sure the developer intent of these pings was to make it easier to deal with campers. However, I think that this mechanic fails in this regard because the campers have access to just as much information as I do, and don\\'t need to focus on moving while utilizing it. On top of that, the fact that I feel like I need to constantly use my map to deal with hyper-aware campers along with the fact that it\\'s pretty much always more valuable to look at it than my actual crosshair, means that I\\'ve quickly started using it as my primary method of navigation. I\\'m 100% certain this is *not* what the developers intended, and it\\'s annoying to me because it means I\\'m not practicing the crosshair placement and information gathering skills that I\\'m crucially lacking. My suggestion to change this is to change the UAV to be based on absolute distance from the last place you had a UAV ping (to prevent walking back and forth for campers), and to make it so if you\\'re moving quickly it happens more like every 10 seconds so that it\\'s not viable to rely purely on the minimap as a means of \"seeing.\"\\n\\nOn post-death damage summaries:  \\nWhen I die and I look at my damage summaries, I often see something that\\'s obviously completely different from what happened, like me dealing 250 damage to someone when I hit nothing, or me dealing nothing when I saw and heard hit indicators. After a while I realized the problem was that if someone other than the person I was fighting killed me, the game prioritized showing my fight results with the most recent \"foe\" over the person I was shooting. To be honest, I\\'m not interested in knowing that some random person killstole me for 30 damage to the chest, I care about the distribution of hits I had against the person I was shooting. It\\'d be great if the game could make its best guess on who I was actually fighting at the time of death, and give me the damage summary for that person as the first thing on the list.\\n\\nOn player count:  \\nI think the player count is essentially fine, but sometimes I find myself spawning in a portion of the map that\\'s completely empty and all nine other people are on the other side. I don\\'t know how the game decides who spawns where, but I think it should be tuned to be slightly more likely to put me at lost close-ish to the majority of the players in the server, otherwise I don\\'t get as much done. This is just an opinion though, I don\\'t know what the developers intentions were for respawning.\\n\\nOn random agents:  \\nI strongly dislike this decision. I spend a majority of my time playing with just two agents in standard games, and I\\'ve become used to the look and sound of those agents to the point where using someone else actually heavily distracts me. The hands look wrong, the voices sound wrong, even the simple knowledge in the back of my head that I\\'m not playing one of the characters I\\'m comfortable with throws me off, despite the fact that there\\'s no abilities. If I want to play with agents I\\'m not used to for the purposes of learning them or something, I\\'d rather do it in actual games, or spike rush, or somewhere that isn\\'t in Deathmatch. It\\'s not like there aren\\'t frequently three people on the same agent anyways, so I don\\'t see the point of randomizing the agent. That being said, I\\'m aware that allowing people to choose agents could slow the rate of play since people might sit around forever picking an agent. Therefore I think you should either have to pick very quickly to get a desired agent (or else it\\'ll be random) or you should have to select your preferred agents outside of the game so it\\'s not part of the queuing process at all.\\n\\nHopefully y\\'all at riot find that helpful, and good luck as you iterate on this new mode!',\n",

I feel like the system works very well for draws IF you have all 5 players on your team, otherwise it's fundamentally flawed because the other team has all the control over the situation AND the 5 person advantage so of course they're gonna vote to continue because it screws you over while they get a (basically) free win even if the other team was better.\\n\\nSolution: Personally I'm not sure because it's hard to keep it fair for both teams in a situation like this where one team has the advantage but should still get a fair vote.

As someone who does not have much time to play any more, DM offers a way to practice in context aim quickly and efficiently, something that I've been lacking. \\n\\nThat being said... I don't agree with the heatmap / location indicators on the minimap. Although they are spaced out enough so that players do not know exactly where other players are, knowing the general area allows players to hold a specific area while knowing when to preaim an angle. Adding to this is how strong Operators are at holding angles (not that awping is inherently bad in DM, though some dislike it...), deathmatch ends up doing the opposite of warming up by encouraging players to either play defensively, knowing exactly where an opponent will peek, or forcing players to try and prefire people who are camping an angle (which doesn't help practicing aim or warming up).\\n\\nCS:GO DM servers usually disable the minimap, and provide spawn invincibility until the player moves. I've noticed that occasionally some players are invincible, but it is far from consistent (I'm not sure how this is coded, maybe just for DC'd players?). Not that CS:GO's community DM servers are the only solution, but right now deathmatch does not feel thought out for what most players are looking for in a warmup / practice tool, let alone to play as a casual gamemode (I mean who really likes jumping in FFA DM only to end up in awp angle holding / prefire simulator)\",\n",

       "   'selftext': \"I know the heart and soul of the game is the core gamemode, no respawn. But personally I would really enjoy COD game modes like capture the flag and king of the hill. I understand the issue with these kind of game modes, is that it will be hard to balance. Certain agents will be much better. But I am sure they will figure out a way to keep things balanced and fair. Now I am sure some people are thinking, oh why don't you just play COD then if you want that kind of experience. Well, what I really love about valorant, is that you can play it on a toaster. I don't have an xbox (and don't want one). I have a XPS 15 with a gtx 1050, which is good to play valorant one. But, its powerful enough for COD and other AAA games. Also, sure COD is way different than the kind of FPS valorant is where gun play is so much more skilful. So I think it will be great to add the gun mechanics of Valorant with arcade style game modes. If Valorant added these games, I would be in love.\",\n",

I said nah you\\'re weird and no more messages but my chat box is filling up with some strange message I\\'ve NEVER seen in this game. I don\\'t remember much but it looked like a file name of sorts. Like \"Something.Idk.Thisandthat.??? denied\". I don\\'t remember exactly what it was but I deleted him and uninstalled the game ASAP. Tried clipping it with shadowplay but it wouldn\\'t when i was outside of the game. I wish I could see the message again but seriously I have no idea what that was about. It seemed like it was trying to download files or something.\\n\\nSorry if this has been brought up before but I couldn\\'t find anything about it and don\\'t even know what I would look up to find it. I figured it would be a pretty well known issue if this wasn\\'t something new.\\n\\nIf anyone knows what this could\\'ve been let me know, changed my valorant pass, do I need to worry about anything else?

You dont get to get any progress from your missions and you don\\'t get any reward in special for standing out in the deathmatch you just played. It is really bad that it doesn\\'t reward you with anything really. Playing a deathmatch and get in 1st place, gets you the same exp as if you win 2 rounds in unrated or finish half of a spike rush.\\n\\nI know the argument could be \"Oh but it\\'s for new players or to practice aim\", that could be a good point if the practice range and tutorial didn\\'t exist. I think Riot could really improve deathmatch if it rewarded with seomthing more than 500xp but that\\'s just me, it just feels like a waste of time when I want to level up my agents and battlepass.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'I have to be honest here, the weapon mechanics are very discouraging. I find myself quite annoyed every time I die in this game, not because of why it happened, but **how**. I\\'m not a perfect player, I make mistakes, a lot of them, not ashamed to admit it, but why is something as stupid as running and shooting so rewarded with such high accuracy? \\n\\nDeathmatch has proven the importance of pre-firing, why bother with learning how to counter-strafe around the corner while aiming at the headshot-level of all the positions, if you can just run out and shoot whatever you have with you at the moment and get the same or even more value out of it?\\n\\nThe weapon layout and behaviour in VALORANT is supposed to resemble the ones of CS:GO, I think that\\'s clear. However, they don\\'t behave the same as their CS counterparts at all, which was most likely not intended and screws up VALORANT\\'s core mechanic: gun play.\\n\\nI\\'ve made a little comparison on how the weapons behave between the games.\\n\\n*Processing video 7wasjcgatlf51...*\\n\\nThere\\'s one very important thing to note when watching the comparison. In VALORANT, the movement barely disrupts the spray pattern, they\\'re pretty much the same but on a bigger scale, which makes them controllable, **while running**, which is stupid. (While running, bullets **nearly never** go below your crosshair.) In CS:GO, movement makes the spray patterns random, which is what makes it so discouraging to do there. There\\'s no consistency to it, therefore it\\'s not worth to do it.\\n\\nI also have several concerns about counter-strafing in VALORANT, well.. rather the lack of its existence. Counter-strafing doesn\\'t actually exist in this game, you get as much value from just letting the character to finish its movement on their own as from stopping the movement yourself.\\n\\n*Processing video 185ox2aeylf51...*\\n\\nAs a CS veteran, having invested thousands of hours across the most memorable CS titles; 1.6, Source, GO, don\\'t know a single game where accuracy matters and counter-strafe doesn\\'t exist. For someone like me, this is not a case of \"just don\\'t do it,\" **this is a tech that\\'s been building up in my muscle memory for more than a decade.** Counter-strafing distinguishes good players from the bad ones. \\n\\nDue to the lack of its existence, this greatly hinders sniper players. Since counter-strafing doesn\\'t exist in VALORANT, all it does is it only adds extra movement. That little piece of movement can **significantly** disrupt the accuracy of a sniper, as shown in the following video:\\n\\n*Processing video liki70qr0mf51...*\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty clear Riot wants the guns to be just as perfect as they are in CS. They\\'re not, and that\\'s the only thing about VALORANT that\\'s keeping me from enjoying it.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'How should you counter the op if your team has no smokes? \\n\\nTo explain, me and my friends arent great at the game il admit but last night we were playing on Ascent and we were up 9 to 3 going into the switch. We were now on offense and won the first round making the game 10 to 3. This is where everything went downhill. They win the next round, no biggie, next round starts. Almost pulled off this round but lost in a 1 on 1 with an op player, score now 10 to 4. From here on out 3 players on their team had ops every round. We did not have any smokes and no matter what we did to try to pick off the guys with ops we either couldnt or we would get the kill only to be killed by another op from a different angle. We were absolutely shut down for the rest of the game we ended up only winning one more round and losing the game 11 to 12.\\n\\nWhat would your approach be to counter this situation? We tried so many different things but no matter what we did it ended with all of us getting oped.\\n\\nFor context out team comp was: Phoenix, Sova, Sage, Raze, and Killjoy.\\n\\nLooking back I think the simple swap of one character for either a brimstone or omen could have made a difference by simply breaking up sight lines but im curious if people have another approach that im just not thinking of. Could also chalk it up to us being kinda shitty at the game',\n",

One called me a gay slur, which was honestly super irritating because I am mostly attracted to dudes, another kept screaming and cussing into his microphone to get onto the site, and another was just flaming me in chat despite the fact that I was higher than him on the leaderboard. The same dude who called me a slur also breathed heavily into his microphone which definitely triggered some sort of anxiety in my friend, so I initiated a minor argument. Has anyone had a streak of unluckiness lately? I’ve been playing Valorant for quite a long time, and I feel like I should be a little used to this, but I cannot handle slurs or what happened to my friend.

I hoped into a spike rush in which people were killing themselves using brimstone abilities (as, as you all know in spike rush all your abilities are already charged from round 1) and although they lose the game, the game gives you 1000 xp at a time. Quite frankly I see this method as inefficient as I've recently been grinding the game to get Killjoy and I've only managed to get half way through level 1 or two I belive. The Xp grind is super tough because you just have to get so much of it. Anwyays I doubt this will be the last time I see anything like this so I was wondering if and although it didn't annoy me, is the right thing to do just report them? If I report them do they get into trouble like does Riot record games to check when sombody has been reported for cheating? Or should I try not to be a Killjoy (get it cos the charecter lol ) and just let em carry on because I won't lie, if I didn't love the game so much and didn't love the rush of playing matches I'd probally do the same. And because I don't wanna get ban. Anwyays what should I do when I encounter Xp Farmers? Should I spoil their fun or just leave it seeing as its only just one Spike rush it isn't that deep.\",\n",

At least with radar pulse the aggressor has a fighting chance against the camper.\\n\\nCampers in DM: why is this a problem in Valorant but not in CSGO? Because of the large footstep radius, slow movement speed and the low TTK. None of these are going to change because they’re part of the core game play.\\n\\nPeople camp in this game and hold angles, especially when there are no abilities to be used. I don’t get why people are complaining about how players are playing DM, because they’re playing how this game is supposed to be played. \\n\\nThis game is not a run and gun shooter, which is why adding DM is like putting a square peg in a round hole.',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'The Hive-Mind weapons, and cards in the battle pass got me thinking what could they mean? I was think back to the 1st battle pass and remembered that 1,there was a group of weapons themed to a group(kingdom)  and agent (killjoy) who was related to the group and  had a card (vertraulich)hidden there as well.   So could it be that the Hive-Minds could be an agent or a game-mode?(i will get back to that later)  \\n\\n\\nWhere this idea starts is at the epoch event card an epoch event as quoted from Wikipedia means \" The epoch moment or date is usually defined from a specific, clear event of change\" The event card depicts a spike explosion. Now this makes me think to real life and the story of aliens being attracted to  nuclear areas and when the Americans droped the nukes in japan was the epoch event of the nuclear age. So could the Hive-Minds be attracted to radiant bringing them to Earth?  \\n\\n\\nNow this is where it gets weird due to lack of things to theorize off of. how the Hive-Mind gets to earth is via a portal like the darkside beyond spray also know as the \"radiant portal\" on the official valorant discord server, now this might be a bit contrary to apart of above because the Hive-Mind player card is known as \"playercardExoAltUniverse\"   \\n\\n\\nNow how this could be a game mode is a style of MvM where the hive-mind will come out of radiant portals and will try to steal more radiant from us, and we will have to defend it. Now remember this is a theory and  there were only a few things i could go over because trying to fit in the X011 experiment card just seemed too bizarre.(also side bit some players will say \"weapon skins are not cannon\" now in my opinion only the ones that come out on the store page are not cannon)  \\n\\n\\nSo I will leave the rest of the theorizing up to you guys, could this be a MvM styled game mode or was this just a bored player theorizing about nothing while waiting for his friends to get on so he can get back to grinding for sliver? We might not know until the final days of the battle pass. But until then have fun theorizing!',\n",

I don’t think I’ve ever experienced a game have leavers this often and with game lengths being this long, it’s honestly pretty infuriating. \\n\\nFrom personal experience, most of the time it’s just kids who overestimate how much time they have.

       "   'selftext': 'I\\'ve played a bunch of Valorant since the beta and have spent 2k+ hours in CSGO. Here are some of my personal thoughts on the current state of deathmatch.\\n\\nOverall, I think it\\'s a good game mode for a deathmatch. It\\'s fun and pacing is fine. However, as a tool for warming up, I believe it is not good enough.\\n\\nIn CSGO, there is an official team deathmatch mode. Much like Valorant\\'s deathmatch, it is time based, there\\'s a delay between spawns, and there\\'s a low amount of players in the server. For a casual game mode, especially for new players, this is definitely sufficient. \\n\\nBut many players are looking for a tool to use for warming up and in this current state, it does not work well. In CSGO, there are custom community servers that have custom game modes, one of which is FFA, or free-for-all. In this deathmatch, there\\'s usually the max amount of people allowed in the server with no pauses between spawns. It is absolutely hectic. You spawn and die immediately multiple times. You barely have time to think. And that\\'s what\\'s good about it. You focus on the aiming and nothing more.\\n\\nMy main issues with Valorant deathmatch as a tool for warming up:\\n\\n* Pacing is too slow. \\n   * The little pause between spawns is frustrating. I personally don\\'t get frustrated playing CSGO FFA, because you\\'re constantly in a battle. You barely have time to contemplate what just happened. In Valorant, in the seconds between, I think about how annoying the camper was or how poor my aim was. \\n   * There\\'s not enough people in the server. I\\'m constantly running around looking for enemies. In CSGO FFA, you spawn and there\\'s someone almost immediately in front of you, or around the corner. You rarely have time to run around\\n   * The pacing of the warm up before the deathmatch is on the right track and reminds me of CSGO FFA. There\\'s no wait time between spawns and it seems to be easier to spawn near enemies allowing for quick practice\\n* Short match time\\n   * When I warm up, I usually warm up for 20+ min. Having the constant down time between queuing and spawning is frustrating\\n* Minimap gives away too much\\n   * Sometimes, I\\'m just constantly staring at the minimap, because it\\'s basically wall hacks. In a casual mode, it\\'s okay, but for warming up, it\\'s really not needed. I understand it\\'s supposed to give away a camper\\'s location, but I believe it\\'s unneeded, especially when the points above are addressed. \\n      * There\\'s no need to camp in a warm up mode as that defeats the purpose of being in a mode to warm up. And if you kill a bunch of people, multiple people know your location and will hunt you down the next time they get to that part of the map. The camping isn\\'t as frustrating when you can instantly respawn back in the action\\n* Health and magazine ammo\\n   * Picking up health is a neat idea and I understand it\\'s supposed to encourage movement, but like the minimap, it\\'s not necessary for warming up. When I kill someone across a site or a long hallway, it\\'s frustrating that the health is so far away and that I\\'ll likely be killed before I get there and thus need to wait to respawn, piling on the frustration \\n\\nSome possible solutions:\\n\\n* Straight up copy FFA DM\\n   * The rules in FFA DM are the way it is, because they work as a tool for warming up\\n      * instant spawning so that you\\'re constantly in the action\\n      * packed servers so there\\'s constant action\\n      * infinite session time so you can practice for as long as you need to\\n      * no minimap since it\\'s super easy to find enemies\\n      * health and magazine ammo refill on kill to allow for long streaks and not to punish those who are doing well (note: some servers only refill on headshots to incentivize better aim)\\n* Build off of \"warm up\"\\n   * As I said, the \"warm up\" period before the start of the deathmatch is not too bad and can be used as a deathmatch\\n* Let there be community servers\\n   * This way users can decide on their own rules for a warm up mode. In addition it allows for the community to come up with new ideas which can lead to cool new features\\n\\nI am not saying to scrap the current deathmatch, as I have said, it\\'s a good casual mode, but for warming up, I believe a different mode is needed that covers all of the points made above.\\n\\nI hope the devs and the community take these points in to consideration and I would love to hear everyone else\\'s thoughts on the game mode',\n",

Sentinels have to fight to defend their newly earned crown and Tsm wants their position as greatest in NA back. Tsm dropped sentinels 2-0 upper finals to knock them down to losers. Sentinels fought back, defeated immortals, and came back swinging. The rematch of century. Tsm starts off with a map up and first map, haven, was their choice. Sentinels didn’t back down and took their map. Tsm didn’t get scared and took split, a map where sentinels were known for their prowess. Then, ascent came. Tsm was known for revolutionizing the sageless comp in this map against t1. Every team adopted this format and sentinels mastered this map with sinatraa’s famous sova Odin plays. They did not disappoint and brought us to a fifth map. The game was neck and neck and eventually sentinels got a 4 in a row, with one round with a 0.03 second defuse, and was at match point. Tsm didn’t stop and dragged it to ot. Tensions were high and Tsm pulled it off, winning 6 rounds in a row to claim back their title as greatest.
